Overall scene is maybe just a bit \"busy\" but that's not your fault and that's nothing distracting! It's a pleasant photo of winter and gives us a sense of tranquility. Well done!",

  "composition": "Composition is pretty good! Shore lines lead our eyes into the shot. Personally I would like more closer foreground details like those stones in the water. That way composition would be even more solid!",
  "use_of_camera": "I guess this was shot around midday. You have exposed the snow very good! Snow should be overexposed around 2 stops, otherwise your image would be underexposed! Shutter speed of 1/50 is borderline if camera is handheld, but since you used tripod everything is sharp!",

  "general_impression": "John,  I took me some time to like this one.  It immediately engaged me because it is so unique and out of the box relative to it not being immediately recognizable as anything in our everyday experience (unless perhaps you're a sand crab). But my next reaction, after appreciating its unique attributes, was to begin to judge it based upon my reticence to ever hang it on my wall.  I soon got over that.   ",

  "composition": "John, There are so many interesting and intriguing elements here that its almost pointless to talk about the standard guidelines of composition.  This image is compositionally chaotic for lack of a better description.  There seems to be no central subject, unless you consider the fairly obscured sea weed segment that is inundated in bubbles, and resting on a very coarse layer of sand (I think its probably sand).  :) Nonetheless it is intriguing and would certainly create a sense of wonder and interest in any viewer.  There is no particular symmetry, or balance to the image so the eye can wander anywhere it wants to.  There are no margin elements to frame this image, nor any s curves or leading lines to gently guide the viewer around the landscape of the composition. The frame is well filled and there is scarcely anywhere in the frame that doesn't contain some manner of form or texture of interest. Yet, throughout this apparent chaos, a pattern does appear if one looks long enough.  To my eye there are three separate textural areas that define this image.  The periphery of sand forms a sort of defacto frame, the edges of the sea plant define the intermediary shape, and the bubbles within a third region of texture and form.  So, though I might not hang this on my wall, I think it is an enigmatic and fairly well formed abstract work that is both intriguing and captivating.  ",

But in this case it takes on the appearance of a black and white ink drawing or wood cut.  The lighting is good, with very nice detail rendering.  there are no harsh highlights, specular or otherwise, and the shadow that is there is directly below the plant, rendering a 3D effect as it separates it nicely from the sand.

  "subject_of_photo": "Hi Chris,  I like the subject of this image, which is not only the two water birds, but rather the interesting interaction between them.  A story telling image is always much more compelling than a simple portrait or presentation style image.  ",
  "composition": "I like how you captured the food exchange so well.  I think the composition of the image is fair, but could be better.  I think there is a general feeling of imbalance by the way the bird on the left is cropped. As a result the image feels as if its being pushed off the frame to the left. I think showing a little more of the left most duck's head and neck curve would have worked better here, especially considering the amount of body that you have included for the baby bird on the right. Also I feel the cropping of just the tail feathers of the baby bird creates a bifurcated feeling on that side as well.I do very much like the pattern of ripples around the birds bodies that nicely draw the eye into and around the composition in a sort of swirling circular motion.   ",
  "use_of_camera": "I think that the image is exposed nicely with the exception of a couple of hot spots below the eye and lower breast of the left most duck which are somewhat blown out and thus lacking in feather detail.  This is most often not a big issue, but in this case the bright spots are in the vicinity of the prime area of interest here, that being the exchange of the fish in the birds beaks. There is also a very small area of blow out in the center of the birds merging beaks. I think since you used a manual exposure setting ( I'm assuming this means that you utilized a full manual method) might have benefited by using a one stop decrease in shutter speed to perhaps 1/500 to reduce the hot spots.  You could also have adjusted the ISO to 100 or so and probably used the same exposure settings to put back some of that highlight detail without overly darkening the overall image. ",

Well done.1/500th of a second is plenty fast to ensure that camera movement won't blur the image, also good.",
  "depth_of_field": "The depth of field at f/4 is generally fairly shallow, especially with either macros or with long, high-magnification lenses. Increasing the depth of filed would improve the margin for error in getting the bird sharp, which might be the better tradeoff; with the higher depth of field, more of the leaves will be sharp, potentially competing visually with the bird.",
  "color_lighting": "The colors, especially the greens, look fine. It looks as if the image is front-lit, and the bird and most of the foliage are in the shade from other foliage. The light on the bird is pretty even except for the highlight on its wing and a hint of highlight on its head. The highlight helps to capture the bird's shape, so this is also good. Well done.",
  "focus": "The bird unfortunately isn't quite sharp. It's clearly the subject of the image, so it needs to be sharp, or at least the eyes need to be tack sharp for the image to feel sharp. It's hard to get the focus spot on with creatures that don't hold still, and birds are notorious for no holding still. ",

There are a number of technical problems with the image, but for an early attempt at black and white, you did a good job. Most of the problems can be fixed with a tripod and an image-editor (I recommend Gimp, which is a free download, or Photoshop Elements which is about $100. Black and white photography is deceptively simple. Instead of color, one must learn to think in terms of shadow and light and tones of grey. Keep practicing in black and white and you'll quickly get better at it. I look forward to seeing more of your work and would be happy to show you how an image-editor will improve this photo if you like. ",

Try varying the placement of the camera to change the perspective.  ",

  "general_impression": "Hi Mohammed. It's not often I am compelled to give an image such a high score, but you have pretty much nailed the brief here. You have applied yourself technically to the problem and have come up with a very high quality image which I am sure your client will be pleased with. You clearly know your craft well and it shows both in your image and your technical data.",
  "subject_of_photo": "Obviously since the brief is determined by your client, the subject is predetermined. I am assuming it is the lounge setting as a whole and you want to illustrate the room and its layout since no particular item jumps out at me. All elements in the frame have been given equal consideration of importance.",
  "composition": "The image has been shot from a great angle limiting distortion and shows the room in a balanced manner. Perhaps next time consider showing more of the armchairs on the left and right. I would also like to see the image more centred. While the couch appears reasonably centred, the lamps towards the rear of the room are not - if going for a symmetrical composition, you want to be spot on with this. Also, I find the tiny bit of the picture frame at the rear on the left a tad distracting. There is not enough of it showing to indicate it is intentional and could be misinterpreted as a mistake - you could consider moving it more into frame, or alternatively cloning it out in post production. Having said that, these are small issues and are easy to rectify.",
  "use_of_camera": "You are clearly someone who has excellent knowledge of your camera. Your choice of ISO 100 is spot on as is your choice of focal length. It is always tricky to shoot wide in a room and to avoid converging lines and/or distortion, but you clearly show technical knowledge having considered your shooting position as well as corrections I am assuming you did in Photoshop.",
  "depth_of_field": "I notice you have opted for an aperture of f6.7.  This is quite an usual aperture to choose - I am assuming it is related to your optimal exposure settings for use with the strobes? Normally for a subject like this I would opt for f8 or above and lengthen my exposure time. Having said that your image is within acceptable sharpness and there is sufficient depth of field.",
  "color_lighting": "Your use of light here is what distinguishes this image from an amateur image. Your light is well controlled and balanced. You clearly understand the use of strobes well, and your colour temperature is spot on. The image has a warm and welcoming feel to it, so well done on setting a great mood with your lighting. Perhaps next time try turning the lamps on, and lowering the power of your strobes so the room has a feeling of being lit by the lamps.",

  "composition": "I for the most part like the composition.  The lone figure is placed well with space to move into as he walks, and oriented approximately 1/3 into the frame from the left.  It is overall a pleasing arrangement of subject and background.  I also think that the bright spot of color on the surfer and his board, are a very pleasing counter point to the almost monochromatic background.  I am a little confounded by some blotchiness and blurred pixels that appear approximately 1/3 of the way in from the right hand margin at approximately the same level of the surfer.  It appears to be cloning artifacts and upon further inspection takes on a similar shape as the surfer on the left side of the frame.  My first thought is that it looks like a ghost left over from a 'content aware move' of the subject.  I can't be sure but there is something amiss with the pixels in that area which extends downwards into the water where a reflection could be expected had there been an object above it previously.  At any rate if it is cloning or healing artifacts they can be concealed well enough with some more manipulation. ",

Color cast is for the most part a personal choice since there is usually no 'wrong' presentation or personal interpretation of a particular color. I think the lighting is even but not particularly compelling or dramatic.  I think it is there to be brought out, but in the current presentation it is somewhat flat.  (except for the surfer)",
  "focus": "The focus looks good to me. I can never tell for sure since at 100 percent, where I would view it to determine focus, the resolution is not particularly good since the images here are downsampled jpegs which lose something in translation.

  "general_impression": "Hi Emilie,Interesting work you've brought fourth, in both these submissions. This image is ambiguous and intriguing in the way it looks like something is going to happen on a bridge and the suggestion of falling occurs but in this case the solution is up, it looks as if the person photographed is preparing to go up.This image however an interesting as it is suffers from a not so good result. The contrast not only is strong but it has passed the threshold of texture. The highlights are unnecessarily burned away  and the shadows so dark we don't have a bridge there any longer. This time of the day has a really difficult light that requires a lot more technical skill if your about to achieve a good result. Let me help you with that.Not having  any detail or texture on the main subject and also not having an obvious reason that could legitimate the absence of texture besides the need for contrast, is the main problem here, then it is the lack of contrast  everywhere else. Makes it look very opaque.Never the less, this is a really good start!Cheers",

It is of course an ocean scene but it is, with the exception of the boat wake, or breaker line that runs horizontally through it, for the most part a pretty bland image.  Open water shots, with no other subject detail or dramatic lighting, are difficult to render in an interesting and compelling way.",
  "composition": "There is no real point of focus or interest in this image.  It could have been taken from a cruise liner.  The lines of the image don't lead the eye anywhere because they are all horizontal, frame to frame, lines. As far as cropping goes I'm not sure that there's any way to crop this image to improve it.  One of its main problems is that it doesn't have enough interesting texture or pattern to be a compelling abstract or background shot, and there is no object of any substance to give the image depth or provide perspective.  ",
  "use_of_camera": "This image is overexposed which results in a very dull and colorless rendering. There is no camera information from which to comment relative to exposure and speed. I can see there are clouds in the sky but they have no features to them and the color looks a little skewed towards the magenta side of the color range.  ",

  "color_lighting": "The color is very flat and unsaturated.  The lighting is also rather flat with few areas of bright highlights and deep shadow. Some photos use muted subtle, even soft focused colors for mood.

  "focus": "The image looks a little out of focus from the middle of the frame upwards.  Its difficult to tell because there are some resolution issues that might be due to the low pixel resolution of the camera.",

  "general_impression": "Hi Caity, Great job capturing the moment. Shooting from a low angle creates a strong connection between the subject and the viewer. I like how the texture of the grasses contrasts with the dog's smooth fur. The soft lighting compliments the mood of the image, but it also causes the eyes to end up a bit dark. This is a small issue and one that can be easily corrected with a little selective lightening.",
  "subject_of_photo": "The subject is clearly defined and there is a good balance between how much space is taekn up by the subject versus the foreground & background.",
  "composition": "The grass around the dog does a good job of framing the subject. I like how you cut off part of the dog on the left, this places more visual weight on the face and the right side of the dog, thereby pulling the viewer's attention across the image. The low perspective effectively gives the viewer a sense of what things look like from the subject's perspective which helps to create a connection between the subject and viewer. ",
  "use_of_camera": "Exposure looks good overall, there is detail throughout the tonal range, from the shadows to the highlights.",
  "depth_of_field": "The balance between in focus and out of focus works well. The sharpest area is the dog, the foreground looks slightly out of focus, and the background is somewhat, but not heavily, out of focus. By not having a heavy background blur it gives the image a sense of place but doesn't distract from the dog.",
  "color_lighting": "The soft lighting creates quiet mood for the photo which fits well with the appearance and body language of the subject. The B&W treatment put the attention on the tonalities and the textures; allowing the textures to wrap around the dog and not have the eye be distracted by the color(s) of the grass. The eyes and the forehead of the dog are a little too dark. While the detail in the eyes and in between the eyes can be seen, these areas don't stand out as much as they should. You want the eyes to be the visual focus on the composition. Selectively lighten these areas a little.",

  "general_impression": "John, I like the image particularly its component parts.  I just don't know if it works well compositionally. As I've said to you on other occassions, its not that any rules here have been broken but I feel that the image doesn't flow well and I feel as if my journey through the frame is impeded.  Partly because of the space on top the door and the way the lines in the image don't go anywhere in particular to draw me to a central point of focus.  A very subjective complaint I would grant you. ",
  "subject_of_photo": "Hi John, Its hard to get tired of old ancient architectural elements, particularly doors, entryways, windows and fences.  This image has a lot of interesting elemental forms and texture and subject wise is a great choice. ",
  "composition": "I don't know about the overall composition here John.  While I like the horizontal vs vertical oppositional line thing, I'm not feeling that the image holds together comfortably. The bench is a nice form but I feel that its placement partway in the frame doesn't flow well. Maybe I'd like to see all of it in this case as it tends to bring the color and texture of the floor more into play.  Also I feel as if there is a bit too much headroom in this image. The eye is drawn to bright areas or areas where unexpected or abrupt 'things' happen.  In this case, I like the nice form of the door header but it terminates before it gets to an edge.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing and I can see why you'd want to show it off, but my eye is drawn to the tiny space on the left side by the frame margin. I sense its a strong leading line but it doesn't take me anywhere. I do like that you've lined up the tile at a diagonal at the apex of the lower left frame.  You could also have cropped up a bit and used the imaginary diagonal formed by the left edge of the door frame and the front edge of the bench as pointers to the left frame corner. I like the softness of the shadow behind the bench and the general absence of shadows elsewhere. ",
  "use_of_camera": "I think the settings and exposures here were fine with the exception of the where you took your spot reading.(see below).  Otherwise everything was fine.  Your shutter speed/focal length combination was fast enought to handhold and avoid blurring, while maintaining a very nice DOF.  Your ISO was optimal at 100.  I usually don't rate these areas however because often the image isn't presented right out of the camera and has been processed with Photoshop and thus difficult to assess the original conditions and results.  ",
  "depth_of_field": "",
  "color_lighting": "I think the overall exposure is pleasing and shows of much of the texture and form that is there.  However since this is a form study, I think that the slight overexposure of the left side of the wall (apparently a strong side light source), as well as a small strip at the top of the door header result in a loss of some interesting texture and detail. I see that you used a spot meter on this one, which I think is great.  However I think you may have exposed on the darker door area and thus rendered your wall a bit brighter than it had to be.  I love the colore of this image.  They are warm and comforting to look at and work very well together.  Earth tones and greens are always a winner.",

  "general_impression": "Hi Doug, I could very well be mistaken, but I do get the feeling that this image is a composite image made from a waterfall location, and a river location.  The juxtaposition, while interesting, creates a little cognitive dissonance for me and looks as if it might not really belong in the scene.  Part of this impression stems from some artifacting, and noise as well as some blurring at the edges of the fall and the river scene. If this is a natural scene then it is truly a unique natural scene. If not. .then it is very creative and compelling. Keep looking for the beauty.    ",
  "subject_of_photo": "I very much like the subject of this image.  Waterfalls are always worth a remark or two. This image is different because it places the waterfall, in an almost freestanding, almost unnatural way, off to the side and, unlike many images of falls, not directly in front of the viewer. ",
  "composition": "Again I think the placement of the main subject is very nicely done.  Using the classic rule of thirds, it is placed in the lower and middle third of the image and thus frames and leads the eye at the same time. The placement also creates a feeling of depth and distance as well as motion from the feathered treatment of the water. Most of this composition is horizontal and vertical, however there is a nice, curvilinear edge to the small island in the middle of the image which helps to draw the eye into the composition. Also the converging ridge lines of the soft hills help to center the viewers attention as well.",
  "use_of_camera": "Here's where I'm a bit confused.  The basic information lists the aperture as f/8 and the speed (this is normally the shutter speed on this site) as 25 1/25th seconds.  However some dialog under description conversely suggests the actual shutter speed was 1 second, and the aperture at f/22.  Also there is a mention of HDR or High Dynamic Range apparently.  I'm going to assume here that there was more than one exposure of this image and they were layered and merged to an HDR output image.  Under those circumstances then the exposure speed and aperture are appropriate. If this is a tone mapped or internal HDR image my only suggestion would be to bring the exposure of the background area down a bit.  It seems on the verge of being blown out and some detail is thus lost in the high foliage of the tree groves. Also there is a bit of middle range dullness on the lower moraine sections of the hills.    ",

  "subject_of_photo": "Hi John,Thanks for choosing me to provide feedback for your shot. This is a great idea from the start, in my opinion. It's always nice to grab an \"in the moment\" shot. You have definitely captured the moment you outline in the description. However, your subject blends in too much with the background and is not readily discernible. At first glance I thought it was a scenic photo of waves crashing on the rocks. The subject is strong but could be stronger, in my opinion.",
  "composition": "The surfer is too close to the center of the image; both horizontally and vertically for my liking. If you ever get an opportunity like this again (I realize this is not always possible), shoot from every possible perspective: squat, lay down, stand on a raised surface, move/pan left, move/pan right, move closer and farther away, etc. You can always crop your photo differently in post-processing. One of my instructors used to say: \"Take more than you need. You can always get rid of the 'junk' later.\" I think this image would be stronger had you been able to get closer to the subject and panned to the left to eliminate the distracting rock at right and include more of the breakwater.",
  "use_of_camera": "I do not judge a photo based on what was used to capture it. It's my view that all cameras are good when used effectively. The Sony A65 was used to effectively captured this moment in time. As previously stated the image, although at an acceptable level of sharpness, would have been even sharper had a faster shutter speed been used. The image seems a bit underexposed and \"flat\". When you are using a camera try to remember to bracket your exposures.",
  "depth_of_field": "",
  "color_lighting": "Unfortunately, the time of day indicated (Afternoon) is a bad time to shoot because the light is too harsh unless you have a lens filter such as a polarizing lens filter. There are different types of polarizing filters and they can be used to enhance the color and saturation of an image. This image is \"flat\". Polarizing filters are not available in image processing software yet they can be simulated in Photoshop.",
  "focus": "The surfer is slightly soft. The Sony A65 has the ability to shoot up to 1/4000th of a second. Take advantage of the faster speeds. That is, use faster shutter speeds than 1/100s. This is an \"action\" shot and a faster shutter speed would allow you the ability to better capture the action without sacrificing sharpness. Of course, with a faster shutter speed you would need a larger aperture than f8 thus losing sharpness in your depth of field but, in this instance, is the depth of field important? With more of the image in focus the overall impression in more dynamic. Try to gain more detail in post-processing. You may be amazed at the dramatic effect it has (like the spray from the waves being sharp).",

  "subject_of_photo": "This is an excellent choice of subject! Reflections in nature are very rewarding to photograph, because they are a showcase of natural beauty and symmetry.",
  "composition": "Because the sky has no texture in it, it does not add to the image. Also, because it creates a bright triangular shape in the top right corner, it draws the eye away from the beautiful reflections. Panning down might have both removed the sky from the image, placed more of the vibrant lit color of the sunlit trees into the reflection, and made the image even more symmetric. Alternatively, even go a bit farther in that direction, and put the horizon higher still, cropping off the sunlit parts of the trees and including only their reflections.",
  "use_of_camera": "The sky might be white because it's overexposed, but other than that the exposure looks good. The shutter speed appears to have been sufficient to enable a sharp shot, without motion blur, and the sunlit parts of the trees are brighter than their reflections -- which is as it should be.",
  "depth_of_field": "The image seems to have enough depth of field, but at this size it is hard to be certain. With shots like this, it's helpful to put the camera on a tripod, stop down the aperture, and use a longer exposure; it smooths out small movements in the water and enables greater depth of field, which will allow larger prints. ",
  "color_lighting": "The image might look a little bit better with some additional saturation (but just a little!) in the sunlit trees. It is however, quite good as it is.This leads to a common quandary; using a polarizer would have cut back on the specular reflections from the sunlit leaves and given them a bit more saturation, but it would also reduce the strength of the beautiful reflection. Since the main subject here is the reflection, I think not using a polarizer, and letting the reflection dominate was the better choice.",
  "focus": "The image looks sharp throughout. The slight blurring in the reflection does not detract from the image, and the textures on the surface are nice and sharp, as are the actual trees.",

  "general_impression": "Mark,I am fully aware this critique had quite a few things that I would have changed. All in all it is not that you have a bad photo, in fact it is a very good image. It is just that there are things that you could do that would make it even better than it is.  Of the three images of yours that I have seen on this website, this one I feel had the most room for improvement. I hope that you will consider the suggestions that I have offered you. Please, on the next outing in low light try the approach I suggested in shooting rapid fire, making slight changes as you go, you will take a lot of images, but you will not miss the image that you were looking for, and who knows, you might get an image that is even better than you expected to get. Mark, do not be afraid to experiment with your camera. F8 is fine, but explore, take a few images in Aperture Priority trying different values. Sometimes the image you wanted will be lurking at F4, instead of F8. As a rule of thumb for me, I like to shoot with Prime Lenses because they are faster lenses, which gives a crisper sharper image and is superior in low light conditions. If you do not have at least one, you owe it to have at least one in your camera bag. The Nikkor 50MM F1.8 or the f1.4 are both excellent choices, and they are inexpensive. Get one and give it a try.Finally,shoot your images in Raw, and use post processing to make your images all that they deserve to be. ",
  "subject_of_photo": "Excellent choice your subject in this image. I like the long lines of the pier, and the shadows it produces in the reflections in the water. My first impression when I saw this image was Wow! A Nikon Shooter, and one that likes to shoot waterscapes. I also shoot Nikon, and like shooting this type of scene, therefor I am most certainly partial to your choice of camera, and subject matter.  That said I do have a few problems with the image which I will go into under the Composition & Perspective section below. I like the placement of the subject in the image, and it takes up the right amount of room inside the frame. You were here at the tail end of the golden hour, and you took a great deal of time it would seem to set up with the tripod, and this time of day, that loss of time can work against you. Consider getting there a bit sooner to allow you to set up,or take some risks and shoot without the tripod. It all comes down to shooting styles, and technique I suppose, and the critique that I offer you here comes from a different shooting style. I often take risks, and experiment; and I see you as a very careful, and method savvy shooter. You are one that I would bet shoots the same scenes, the same way, always, day after day. Nothing wrong with that, but consider taking some risks, take a walk on the wild side! This conclusion I have drawn, having not only seen this submission, but also some others that you have posted earlier on this site. You have the ability to shoot a good image, but I think it is time for you to take it to another level, stretch yourself, and take a few risks. Approach your next photo outing with the mindset of shooting your subject from more than one perspective.      ",
  "composition": "I do see in your work that you pay a great deal of attention to symmetry, you like long lines, as is evidenced in this image, as well as others that you have post for critique elsewhere on the web site. In this case however, those lines have hurt you a bit with the roof line as it blends into the background shoreline so well that you can not tell where one begins, and the other ends. I found that to be a distraction.You might consider taking several exposures and moving around a bit so as to break up the lines to the point where you can see a roof instead of a monolith that might be a roof line, or a hilltop. What if you shot this laying prone? How about if you lowered the tripod a bit, or perhaps walked ten feet to the right or left? I can not know what would have been a better image for you, only you can determine that, but the idea I am trying to convey is to not be afraid to experiment, and take lots of exposures.There is no listing as to what lens you actually are using, no exif information given,so what I am trying to convey to you is coming from a gut feeling. All the information are considerations, suggestions that you might consider.I did like the fact that the water had what appeared to be fog,beginning to form on the distant shore. You could have brought that mist out a bit to make more of a statement in post processing.              ",
  "use_of_camera": "     You were losing the light rapidly, and this caused your image to appear rather flat as opposed to one with depth. You did a great job with the water in the foreground, and the subject in relation,F8, was a safe choice, but I would have chosen a lower number, and adjusted ISO, and shutter speed perhaps dragging, (slowing) the shutter a bit, and shooting with a wide angle lens.Another consideration is that you might have adjusted the picture control to vivid, which would have boosted the colors of the sunset and made the image \"Pop\" more.When the sunlight is fading at the end of the day, often I will take a rapid fire approach, shooting a series of images, changing ISO, shutter speed, and aperture with each image. It does not take more than 30 seconds for the light to drop off as the sun sinks into the horizon, so consider using this same approach your next outing in the evening. If you shoot early in the AM, the same approach should be used only in reverse. You have to adjust as the light changes in the sun rise, sun set situations.",
  "depth_of_field": " The depth of field was adequate for this photo. ",
  "color_lighting": "What drew you to take the shot in the first place? That's right, that big beautiful sky. Do not worry, you can still make this image what it wants to be, but you will make it happen in post processing. Many shooters overdo the post, and many more are purists who only want the image as it came out of the camera. I personally am somewhere in between. I do take steps to get the image as close as I can to right inside the camera, but I do have my post processing to correct the things that take away from the image. Mark, I mention this again based on this image, and others that you have posted here. I get the feeling that you are a purist. There is something to be said for that, however this image can be much more than it is with a little tweak here and there. The things I have mentioned earlier with the color boost, the picture control, the high pass, all can be easily changed using Capture NX2, if you took the image as a Raw, NEF file. The best thing about this processing system is that it does an excellent job of color correction using the same software, that your camera uses when the image was taken. It is like you stepped into the camera and made the changes yourself. Those changes can also be changed again at a later date should you decide that you are not happy. This program does not forever destroy, or change the original photo, it is non destructive. Mark another change that you will want to make is to remove that large dark spot that lies above the roof just right of center. That will only take a second using the healing brush.   ",

This is another image that would give a very nice black and white result and now you have some pointers on how to do that with the previous post-processing job I just did for you.Anyway, as it is, this image is definitely over exposed on the highlights and this is in most part because you've let the camera do it for you. By now you know all the talk I usually give about auto vs manual shooting, but I can just not reference it here once more. The shadows look great though, and the over exposure of the highlights is not so bad, you still have more areas with texture.The shot is a bit cold due to the shadows reflecting the blue sky above.The tiny droplets of water that are lifting up giving this spray look on top of the rocks are very well represented here. Once more, you have chosen a good angle to shoot the light.Cheers",

  "subject_of_photo": "Birds of prey, in my opinion, almost always make great subjects to photograph. I love nature also. In this photo I see the intense look of the hawk. I see its pride, beauty and the mystery surrounding it. Why did it decide to land on this post? What is it thinking? What is its next move? For me, many thoughts surround this image. I genuinely like the contrast between the hawk and the background. You saw a great opportunity and you grabbed it. You are correct in that there is a great contrast between the hawk's colors and the background. The contrast makes the hawk that much more vibrant and prominent.",
  "composition": "The position of the horizon compliments the image by providing a bit of separation between the subject's head and body. The intense look of the face on a bird of prey can make or break a photo. The majority of your raptor is too close to the center of the frame. I realize that sometimes it's imperative to \"get the shot\" and centering your subject is your only choice. However, you can change this in post processing by cropping it differently. Most of the time it can be done with the software that accompanies a digital camera. This shot may have been better if shot as a vertical thus capturing more of the tail feathers, weathered post and sky OR if you had moved a bit to the left to put the hawk more into the right hand thirds thus removing the bush/tree at left and putting the distant building more in behind the hawk making it more obscure. On a last note... always take \"more than you need\" when composing a shot. It can be cropped later in post processing as we used to do in the dark room.",

Much of this would be eliminated if cropped differently of shot vertically.",

  "general_impression": "Hi Natasha,You've made a good general impression although and this is a good portrait of your nieces I'm not that much impressed. This stands to mean that in my view you should absolutely keep on shooting and trying to do it better (I'll give you some suggestions at length for that) because it's clear that you have what it takes to do good.When doing this again don't shoot right away, look carefully and see if you can improve the composition by taking some sort of position regarding where to frame their faces. They're right in the middle and this shot could be better if they were, lets say, a little to the right (our right). That way there would be a little more space from the left niece's foot and the margin. But this could work, right smack in the middle can work very well, only it needs perfect execution to be convincing.I hope you didn't find me to hard on you as I'm trying to be fare and like this you  know that you can count on me to tell you the truth and seriously help you do better.Till next time!Cheers!",
  "subject_of_photo": "Kids are one of my favorite subjects but I rather have them act in their own because there is a richness into them we can never tap into. The straightforward portrait with your subject looking into our eyes (into the lens) is usually the most unforgiving since it hides what is really happening there.The frame can be fun but it's a little bit of a clich for it has been used a lot for some time now, you need some sort of twist to make it work to your advantage. It will always be fun though as we can see here they're enjoying it.This is the sort of subject that needs perfect execution to be impressive.",

  "general_impression": "This is a pretty good shot! I must say I was impressed. Surely wasn't expecting this god of a photograph to comment on and rate. Congratulations!, at least in your choice of this one to put in here. You know, your photography is not about your shots, but about your choices among your shots. If you chose it it's yours, it's just as simple as that, and as long as you keep improving your choices your work will keep getting better and better. You'll get to a stage where you know exactly what you want and will just go do it.In sum, this photograph gives me a good sense of the space where the turtle is swimming, and makes me want to glide under the water level, enjoying all the pleasures of a well spent day. The way this turtle is close to the sea bed and the water level is great. You really caught a wonderful photogenic opportunity.",
  "subject_of_photo": "It's always good to do something different and underwater photography is, again, always a good way to go. On top of that your subject is quite interesting. I guess we feel some kind of metaphysical reassurance with reflections on water, and even more when the reflection is on top. There is something about symmetry and perfection that I could never put my head on entirely. We're just from from Renaissance, didn't really moved from that age, we're still there. Plus, the turtle is coming right at us in a way that we inevitably fall into your position during the making of this photograph. It's good \"wild life\" documentary work with a touch of artistic sensibility. Well done!It's great the way the turtle is crossing the mirror barrier with it's head, making wave patterns that reflect it's colors very nicely.",
  "composition": "Regarding composition and perspective I really don't have much to say, it's done in a very classical way, and the classical works every time. It's a good use of the rule of thirds for composition, wile having the frame divided in four in the same time. This is also a pretty valid point of view, though I would like to see the full turtle on a wider frame, and I'm guessing you have some more of that. And maybe, just maybe, you have reframed the picture on a digital post-processing crop. Not saying you shouldn't because if you did you did it well, it works. But the horizontal line could be leveled, it would compliment the perfection of the classical approach.I love the depth of field here. Usually a deep field it's hard to make work unless you're capturing a seamless landscape, blurring the background is a good way of making sure you won't have any unwanted distractions from your subject. Obviously you don't have any problem with your subject, as we only notice the fish, the four fish it seems in the somewhat near background, a few seconds after having recognized the full features of the turtle. This might also be due to a problem we'll discuss ahead.This is almost a high key photograph due to the dominance of light over shadow, but miss interpret what I'm saying, it really works. And it would be very hard to do it otherwise because this see bed is white sand and you clearly have a clean and strong day light working for you. I can't really say it's day light, nor I can vouch this is any sea bed. I could be a very sophisticated aquarium (the perspective of what we have here is quite enclosed, it doesn't need to have been done in a wide space like the sea) and the light, for the water to be crisp clear, could be artificial, some kind of neon maybe... But I'm going for the real thing, in the sea, perhaps in a known site for it's sea wild life. It could be the Galapagos.",
  "use_of_camera": "All the advertisement I've seen and reviews I've read say this is the right camera for the job. Well, I have to agree in a way but this thing is: if you want to do great photography you must be in total control of your camera. And although a compact as this one is more than enough to do great pictures like this snap shot pf yours, there is nothing that compares to using a full featured SLR. But don't get me wrong, I'm thinking about getting one of these for me. The waterproof casings for most SLRs, or DSLRs are prohibitively expensive. It's a too big investment if you're not going to get any profits from it. Any way, if I could just now I would go for the waterproof casing form my Nikon D700, but I can't as is costs more than the camera, so this tough Olympus is a good choice, even if it is a consumer product. It may do the job. But than again, this is good for a kind of a photo diary as a complement to any more serious photography and you used it well.Regarding any of the possible controls of this camera I just don't know, so I'm going to say that this picture is a little over exposed, just a little, because it works like this, although it could be better. But this is something you can correct in any good photo editing software and the correction would be minimal. If your going for the high key is one thing and you should go all the way, making it even more white but taking care that highlights wouldn't loose their texture. The easy way would be to make it just a little darker.The color temperature also needs some work done. The shot is a bit greenish. Not that this is totally wrong, it isn't, but it could be much better if the white balance had been done for the green and cyan dominance in these waters. This, again, is very easy to solve in good software.The speed is fast as it should be to freeze the subject into a crisp and clear look(the way for this photograph to make an impression as it does) but there is nothing to say about this as the camera probably has most of it done from factory and you only have minor choices to do. This is a personal radical sports camera...The focal length you obviously can control, as today all compact cameras that are worthy of buying have a good zoom range and this one seems to have a very good wide-angle range. Your choice was the right one for the look you were going after. You want to have it all in and in this tight spot there wasn't any other choice.",
  "depth_of_field": "The depth of field is good, as said before, but we don't really have a far away field to be worried about it. It's just good that we can see those fish in the background helping make this picture the good document of real wild life that it is. My only reservation is due to the fact that this might simply not be the photographers decision. We never know with these do everything compact cameras.",
  "color_lighting": "This is where you have a problem. The colors are pretty pale, but this is also due to the lack of contrast, again easily solve in good software. What you can't solve in good software is the lack of information on the original file. This version here in Guru Shots has very few chances of getting much better... Can this camera save images in RAW files? That would be the way to go for this situation, giving you the chance for improving the colors. Correcting the white balance just isn't enough, at least in this small version saved for web to be shown here.The lighting is very nice! I would rate it higher if the colors weren't so pale. You have the main light coming from right at a low angle suggesting this is early on the day of late in the afternoon. It's very good light for texture and depth, and you got a very good angle on the shadowed side. Plus, the white sand sea bed makes the perfect reflector to fill in all the shadows. This is what makes this shot a good candidate for a high key. I love backlit subjects! It's strong and dramatic. ",
  "focus": "The focus is right on the spot, as it seams to be in the this very small version of your photograph, but you also have a big depth of field, so it's natural that the eyes are in perfect focus. This is the good side of working with minimal aperture, your depth of field gets to be so big that you don't really have to worry with getting the perfect focus.I have never used your camera, so I don't know what kind of controls you have, or the degree of control, but I guess you can't control much... and this is a factory setting for best results. So, I'm giving you 7 because the focus is good, not knowing if you did it consciously. But one thing is certain, this is not your first photograph with this camera and you knowing what could come out of the shot must be taken into account. The camera might also have image stabilization and some kind of AF tracking system. Any way, you did a good job.",

It's something of a hidden tension. This is really good! Also, the fact that I can't see her eyes very easily help this effect.There are a few execution issues that prevent the shot from being a great result, namely: excessive contrast and over exposure of highlights, but I really like what you have going here. This is like a fashion shot and in the same time isn't. It's ambiguous. Well done!I also like the contrast between her hair and the naked branches, as well as the contrast between your subject and the darker background.Cheers",

Like I said, it's a waffle though, because the water is already blurred, so f/22 might indeed be the way to go.",
  "color_lighting": "Lighting is dramatic, which is great. My only gripe is that the green leaves look a little too saturated. Perhaps this is from the way they were post processed. If you were adding saturation to the scene to get the woody areas to be more dramatic, one option would have been to mask off the leaves from at least part of that. However, some of what I'm seeing could be an artifact of the whole web viewing process.",

  "general_impression": "Hi Brian,Thank you for the opportunity to talk about your image. One of the biggest elements in documentary photography is conveying a message. I think you have a great start here with some powerful elements in this image. You have clearly conveyed a story, your story. There is some fine tuning in the lighting and composition that will make this even a stronger image and statement. This image is a good detail image that will make other images in your series stronger. Something to think about with your story is image placement. Each image works with what it is next too and creates a larger or third meaning. While this image is strong by itself, it can strengthen your narrative by placement with another image and give us insight into the King in this story. Great job, keep up the good work. You just need to think about the lighting and angle while you are working.",

  "composition": "",
  "use_of_camera": "The shadow area is blocked up and the highlights are clipping. I can see from the natural light there is a window you could use to reflect some light into the dark areas with a reflector or white board. You could also use fill flash in those areas. This is a nice detail image that goes to the personality of the person living here. Wide angle lenses tend to distort the edges. You can minimize this by moving your position thereby centering the chair better under the pictures in the background and balancing the distortion in the wood paneling. ",
  "depth_of_field": "The depth of field could be more in this image because the details of the pictures, old heater vent and tattered chair are part of the story. You already are using a tripod for a long exposure, close down your aperture and use a longer shutter speed. This is a sad story of abuse and many of the elements in this story are in the fine details. Details are often overlooked in life and by enhancing all the little elements of this image, you are adding more narrative to your story.",
  "color_lighting": "Color is little off because you used auto white balance. If you set the lighting for a daylight temperature, you will get better overall color. Most images have some shift that can be corrected in post. ",
  "focus": "Focus is sharp and the main element in the image, the chair, is prominently placed. The main focus in this image is the chair, but I also think the other details in the room could have also been included with a sharper focus. This is one of those images where the details add more narrative to main subject matter and collectively give more power to the overall image. The chair is described by the all the little details and wouldn't have the same meaning without them. So, in this case, including all those elements would deepen your story.",

  "subject_of_photo": "Larry, this is a very nice image.  As is generally true with beautifully illuminated classic architecture, it is both pleasing to the eye and soul.  ",
  "composition": "The image is well balanced, and generally pleasing to the eye.  It is unremarkable relative to strong leading lines, or a dynamic point of view, but presents well as a traditional lateral composition.  I'm not real hot on the foreground line that runs from left to right at a slight downward curve.  I think it might be a cleaner composition without the foreground sidewalk and plants and just more water and reflection. The foreground's tilt tends to create an illusion that the composition is skewed, which it is not. Also the tree in the front of the Palace itself seems to detract from the symmetry of the architecture. Of course you have no control over where the city plants trees, but perhaps a different point of view, say to your left a bit more would have opened up the face of the structure somewhat and moved the tree to a place between the far right side of the dome and the line of columns to its right.

  "use_of_camera": "I think your camera settings were very good for this shot.  There is little or no noise despite the longer exposure time, and this is primarily due to the low ISO setting you used.  The aperture of 7.1 was probably near the lenses sweet spot and so created a very nice and deep depth of field. A very good lens to use for this image.  One of my favorites.  ",

I think the most compelling part of this image is the sky and the water texture and nicely scalloped edges of the water as it recedes back into the surf. Because these facets hold the main interest, you might wish to consider a more vertical orientation (portrait) to take advantage of the leading lines of the water edges.  But your orientation isn't by any means 'wrong'. I like that you included a rock in the foreground as it provides some sense of scale and often provides a visual anchor. I do think the placement could be a little different and less centrally oriented in the frame.  I also think your point of view could be a bit lower for a bit more dynamism and presence.  ",

  "color_lighting": "I very much like the muted, soft pastel colors of this image.  I have similar ocean shots of the sunrise that have that same pink/salmon/magenta hue.  The reflected hue in the water ties together the two major areas, sky and sea, nicely. The only thing that I find in need of attention in this image is the lack of contrast in the image.  The image is exposed so that the midtones are accentuated, and as a result there is a flattening of the contrast and a resulting 'dullness'.  This is however something you can deal with in post processing if you have a mind to do so. ",
  "focus": "I feel, from the resolution provided me, that the image detail, other than the water which is beautifully rendered, is a bit on the soft side. I assume you used a tripod since your exposure was slow in order to capture the nice soft water effect. But the softness could simply be wind, or vibration from water around the tripod, or simply a less than optimal focus on a hard defined edge considering the amount of light you had to work with.  Or it could simply be that the resolution provided on this site does not effectively show the edge detail.   ",

Overall I find this a very pleasant shot but there a couple of suggestions I'd like to make which I feel will improve your shot. The most obvious one to me is the cats collar. Either take it off or crop it out of the shot and as I said previously, seeing the ear tip would have made a better impression. The other points you can try and see how things go for you. I hope my suggestions are helpful to you but if you want to ask anything about my comments then please get back to me via the messaging service.RegardsKen",

  "general_impression": "Hi Joshua,  I think this image presents very well and is a nice 'portraiture' rendition of a deer.  There is nothing particularly dynamic or powerful about this image, and there doesn't have to be.  It is a very nice capture of a deer in its element, caught in a moment of time where its attention was directed at you, and you at him.  This facet adds a level of personal connection to the scene that would not necessarily be there had the deer been running laterally, or looking elsewhere in the frame.  Below are some thoughts regarding your image and some suggestions that you may wish to consider in regards to improving its presentation.  ",
  "subject_of_photo": "Hi Joshua.  Animals in the wild are always interesting subjects to capture because they are, no matter how rare or plentiful they may be, are always a surprise to us when we find them in their natural state.  Deep photos are not particularly unique and so do not inspire the awe that say a photo of a snow leopard might, nonetheless; your photo is a nice, straight forward presentation rendition that profiles the animal well.  ",
  "composition": "The composition here is pretty good.  Normally I would suggest NOT placing your main subject spot in the center of the composition.  But here the placement is not a disadvantage considering the rather static posture of the deer - almost as if he had posed for you.  On the other hand, if the deer was in motion and moving from left to right I'd suggest you place the deer in the rightmost third portion of the image to give him 'room to run' so to speak.  Because of the static nature of the image there is very little dynamic tension here.  But since it has the look of an animal portrait that lack of dynamism is not so much a limiting factor.  The background environment in which you shot the deer presents a minor issue in regards to the relative clarity of the subject.  All the competing twigs, branches, leaves and patterns behind the deer, tend to create complex patterns in which the deer is obscured and therefore less prominent to the eye.   ",
  "use_of_camera": "There is nothing particularly wrong with your camera settings. In fact, under better lighting conditions they would be very good.  Your aperture setting of  F/8 is probably pretty much a sweet spot for ensuring good clarity in the image throughout the focal plane.  Therein lies an issue. A larger aperture setting would have allowed you to possibly put the background detail in softer relief and thus 'pop' out your main subject a bit more.  Having said this I'll also acknowledge that it appears you were shooting in lighting conditions that may have been overcast or cloudy (judging from the lack of contrast and shadow detail and it being 5:00 in the afternoon).  So in order to get your background sufficiently soft you would probably had to shoot at an aperture much wider and consequently requiring a shutter speed that was very slow, say three or four stops slower, say at perhaps 1/60.  Unless you were using a tripod and your subject was standing fairly still, you might have had difficulty here. Or you could have pumped up your ISO to a level that would have allowed you greater latitude with your aperture while still maintaining a relatively fast shutter speed.  But then noise is always more of an issue.  Later I'll discuss blurring DOF potential in post processing.",
  "depth_of_field": "The entire depth of field in this photo is very deep, but as a result the background is in sharp relief and thus competes with the foreground for clarity.  In such a shooting environment a shallow depth of field I think would work better to showcase your subject, the deer.  ",
  "color_lighting": "It appears as if your image is lit very evenly.  Since it is late in the day I'm assuming your light was low in the sky but diffused by over cast or clouds, judging from the lack of shadows in the photo. I think this works well considering the complexity of the background.  Harsher sidelight would have caused even more background complexity and thus lack of an apparent point of focus for your subject. I also like the muted yet compelling colors in the composition.  It leaves one with the appropriate sense that the subject was captured within its natural element of earth tones and green foliage.",

Forgive here as I'm going to be talking about an imaginary perfect world, where we can control how and where these birds fly. you see for me there are either too many birds or too few to create a really strong image, if the image had been packed with these birds filling and even over flowing outside the frame then that would create some really interesting shapes and a sense of the birds migrating which helps to build a story of these animals. On the other hand had there just been one or maximum 3 or 4 birds in the frame then the eye would be pulled into those few birds making the story about a family of birds. As it is at the moment I feel my eye being pulled from left to right along the line of birds and continuing outside of the frame. It just feels slightly awkward to have the birds on the right overlapped so much and then half outside the frame. I totally appreciated that you can only shoot what is there so in this example I would have actually liked to see this shot wider so as none of the birds where cropped and have have them flying at the bottom of the frame, also perhaps shot from lower down as I find it more natural to see birds flying above me than at the same level.",

  "general_impression": "Nick Great shot! and time , early evening. You have produced a very moody photograph, the late evening sun cast super lighting over the land area's giving high lights to the leading grass, and diagonal line from there to light house which branches over in balance to the sun making your eye travel throughout the photograph. Love IT !!",
  "subject_of_photo": "Wow  Nick !! what a beautiful shot. this is a great example of a photograph that  has IMPACT !! the elements that pull this image together so well is the Mood Detail in foreground  and of course the lighting ( time of day) sunset. I'll mention them all for other s to see, It  is layered by foreground middle ground and back ground , leading edges of the sun light grass on the right and detail in most area's, the clouds have a nice aurora brought on by the sunset and the blue of the sky at this time is very rich. I was edging toward a ten over all, but I see two small area's I explain further on.  This is very worthy Nick to make a wall print and Hang it !!! ",
  "composition": "Nick I will touch on only one area here, the roadway or wall on the left leading up to the light house is slightly cut to close to the edge of the print, if you would have moved the camera angle only a little more to the left there would be a little more breathing room for this road, and you would have not suffered any by the sun being  a little more to the right. Beautifully  layered and the lighthouse and sun are generally on the same plain and balance each other well! The diagonal lines of the grass that is sunlight on the right lead you eye through out the whole shot and balance the foreground by detail and mood. You are right  I would have done the same and leave more sky , lowering the camera angle to reduce it would have given to much foregraound , there is enough holding that area together well !",
  "use_of_camera": "Nick al settings used are great, 48 mm close to realism what the eye  sees. I understand your concerns with max use at f 11 most digital camera's and lens can produce max sharpness and depth of field with out distortion at f 13, after that  perspective distortion and lens fall off will take place on the outer perimeter of the Photograph.",
  "depth_of_field": "Great depth fro the three layers !!",
  "color_lighting": "Nick  my second little area  is here, and is sometimes difficult to conquer. the white with the sun could be reduced in lightroom, just a little to gain  a little more detail ( reduce the whites). Most times it will work with this adjustment  but not always. I think it would help here at least a little.",

  "general_impression": "Hi Cliff, You've captured a majestic scene here. The view across the mountain tops with star burst of the sun above gives the viewer the feeling of being on top of the world. However, I find the foreground does not add a lot to the composition and if it was less prominent it would make for a stronger image. If you could have walked across the foreground to get a clearer view of the other mountains that would have improved the composition.",
  "subject_of_photo": "The composition suggests the mountains are the key elements, but the expanse in the foreground blocks the view behind, drawing too much attention to itself.",
  "composition": "The foreground is very prominent, but doesn't contain much that is of interest. The viewer's eye quickly moves past the foreground, but then the mountains behind are mostly dark due to the position of the sun, making it hard to see their detail and shape. The sky looks great, nice variety of color and mix of clouds and sky. The star burst like rendering of the sun adds a strong point of interest, and a focal point for the viewer's attention in the composition.",

  "color_lighting": "The mix of colors in the sky is a strong element in the image. The lighting is more of a challenge.

The mountains across the center of the image do have form and shape to them, but this is hidden in the shadows, making them appear more two dimensional.",

As a result it presents more two dimensional than it might otherwise look with strong leading lines.  Nonetheless it has other elements that serve the purpose pretty well.  The interesting form elements in each of the horizontal features creates a sense of layering into the distance that does create apparent depth and distance.  There is a hint of depth as well in the water element in the foreground as it subtly curves into the image and around a slight bend to the left. Also the contrast between the layers creates a feeling of dimensionality that might not otherwise be as apparent if the areas of light and dark were less dynamic.    ",

The eye is led to many different places within the frame and it lacks a central 'wow' factor main subject. Maybe too many elements competing with each other?

Alternatively, you might have left the truck blurred but had the leaves in focus.  So you need to pay more attention to depth of field.  Also, I have a feeling that the camera may have been hand-held, but for a slow shutter speed you really need to use a tripod.  This might account for why the leaves are blurred.",

  "general_impression": "Hi Molly,This is a great start capturing effects of light on water at night. With more practice and experimentation, you will be capturing the beauty of light at night. Photographing subjects at night is a little tricky to balance the ISO and effects of the lights. Each subject takes some experimentation to get the best exposure. I am going to make a few suggestions regarding composition, focus, shutter and ISO speeds. Night photography is more difficult than a typical daytime shot, but with some patience and practice you will make huge progress in a short time. ",

You have some good things going on here with the active framing and strong diagonal of the bridge lighting, but the effect is reduced because of the right side of the image throws off the balance.

First of all icicle on the left part of the picture touches the edge of the frame. It would be better to leave just a little bit of space there to give it a bit more room. Second of all the right side of your picture is just black which makes it look 'empty'. If you would have move your camera a bit more to the left you would have given the icicle more room and eliminated the right black section.",
  "use_of_camera": "First of all, bravo that you are photographing in manual mode!! That't the way to go!But we also have an interesting thing here. You made this picture on ISO 800 with 1/2000 sec on manual mode. My biggest question here is why ISO 800 in combination with a very fast shutter speed of 1/2000 sec? Were you trying to freeze something that was moving like falling drops of water? If so, then I would very much like to see how that turned out.But since these icicles don't move I would have probably lowered my ISO to 100 or even 50 and adjust the shutter speed accordingly. By using a low ISO you also eliminate noise which, in the case of this picture, is a bit visible.",
  "depth_of_field": "I can understand that you used f2.8 but even if you would have used lets say f4.0 or f5.6 you probably would have ended up with the same image. The advantage of using a  little bit smaller aperture is that it adds to the sharpness and focus of the image. ",

  "general_impression": "Wow, Bex, I really hated to be negative. You've just jumped into wild life photography, and you see already how hard it is. But I truly believe that your camera is the culprit here.  What you're asking your equipment to do is not really what it was designed for. Can you more up to something like the Canon Rebel? Not too expensive, and I guarantee that you'd have instant improvement of 100% - more.  ",
  "subject_of_photo": " You got pretty close - good! Generally it's best to either show the entire bird or just a head and beak. Wild life aficionados like to see something dynamic going on - a cocked head, beady eye, bill full of an insect, etc. How long did you have to wait? Many wild life photographers wait days for a single shot, sometimes they don't get it at all!",
  "composition": "Isolating birds from their environment is both hard and essential to achieving an impactful picture. The tree branches add nothing, and in fact the tangle of dark cross pieces is detracting. Cropping these out- either in camera or in postproduction- would greatly improve the composition. Think if you are making a portrait or an action picture. Find out about the \"Rule of Thirds\", or placement of the main subject within borders. This alone will be a great help.",
  "use_of_camera": "My feeling is that you have good intention, but definitely not the right equipment for the technical things you want to do. Here's a quote right off C/NET evaluating the Samsung HZ15W. \"The bad: Subpar photo quality. The bottom line: The Samsung HZ15W has good parts and features, but it ultimately disappoints on the whole. The Samsung HZ15W is a camera that looks good on paper but doesn't live up to the specs. The main attraction is the 24mm-equivalent wide-angle lens with 10x zoom, which is certainly a plus in a camera this size, giving you a lot of shooting flexibility for less than $280. It also has plenty of features to keep you experimenting with your photography. On the other hand, the lens doesn't result in the greatest pictures.\"  My advice: you know what you want; find better equipment as soon as you can. Try the utility at Cameratico.com which will help you to pick what's right for you in your price range.",
  "depth_of_field": "With the caveat that you must be pinpoint sharp on the main subject, you by fortune have made the other elements out of focus. This is exactly what is needed.",
  "color_lighting": "Please see above, as the image displayed show little of what I know must have been in your inspiration and intent. The day is dull, which does not help the impact. The camera itself set too low an exposure, because the white sky background \"confused\" it. That's why you got dull, grey tones. We are aching to see sharp, colorful details in the feathers and head. The camera has simply not allowed the bird-personality to come through.",
  "focus": "Wild life images need to be crisp, repeat that super crisp. Nothing in the web rendition looks really sharp. Sometimes the type of zoom on this kind of camera should be blamed for soft focus.",

  "general_impression": "Hi Avery - Overall, this is a very strong image.  Your sister looks lovely and that is often the purpose in doing a portrait of someone. The strategies you used throughout (exposure, composition, DOF, finding the light, etc.) were very strong.  I would love to see more of your work and if it holds up like this, you will be a strong shooter!!  Keep up the good work!!",
  "subject_of_photo": "People always make wonderful subjects.  I like how you weren't afraid to come in close and by focusing on her eyes, you really bring me into this person... the point of a portrait. Good job!",
  "composition": "Again, I love that you weren't afraid to get in really tight.  There is an organic movement within the frame bringing me first to her right (left of frame) eye because it's the most focused point and an eye and then I move to the next eye.  The rest of the face adds then rather than distracts by being placed well in the frame. ",
  "use_of_camera": "Considering you were shooting at noon, you did a great job with light and therefore not having to deal with the extremes of light that noon often brings to a shoot.  However, I feel it is a bit over exposed as you lose detail in your highlight areas, mostly along her nose and the hair on the bright side.  In digital photography, once you lose your highlights, they are NOT coming back.  You are better to expose less and bring in your shadows, which have more infomation and is definitely more saveable than losing your highlights.  Another option is to expose less still, but add some fill, if you want to do it all in camera and not do any post to bring back in the shadowy areas. Exposing less will allow you to have detail throughout the entire image, including your highlights.",
  "depth_of_field": "As I mentioned before, the DOF and having that focus on the eye, brings the viewer right in where you want them to be.  You were careful and got the focus precise and using the narrow DOF served to make this a stronger image for you.  Great job!!",
  "color_lighting": "Since you did the shoot at noon, this is great. You were able to find nice, natural light at that time of day, which is fabulous! Sometimes the shoots happen then and you have to find a way to deal with it.  You did that wonderfully!  Good job!",
  "focus": "Shallow depth of field, making the focus directly on her eye brings me right in to where you want me to be.  It's great.  More DOF would have made everything sharp and the viewer would be unsure where to look and that could cause other elements, such as her nose (being central) to become a distraction.  This use is very directive which is good. ",

  "subject_of_photo": "The subject appears to be of a lovely vista in the countryside. The mountains are picturesque and the graduations in the mountains are visually interesting.",
  "composition": "The overall composition is pretty good for an amateur as it uses the rule of thirds. The horizon line which is formed by the far edge of the lake is in an ideal position. There may be a very slight lean on the left downwards by a mm or 2, the photographer should check this by using a guide in Photoshop or Lightroom (or whatever developing software they are using). I'm distracted by something out of focus and grey on the bottom right of the frame, this should be cropped out either in the shooting stage or in post production.",
  "use_of_camera": "The photographer should take time to learn about histograms and reading light if serious about photography. Even though composition is good, the overall exposure appears somewhat under as the file is very flat. I am also interested to know why the photographer chose to shoot from a car window and didn't get out to shoot the vista if in such a beautiful place as Loch Ness. ",
  "depth_of_field": "As I mentioned above, a short depth of field is fine when shooting a landscape if you have something interesting to focus on which creates visual interest. Otherwise stick to narrow F stops. The image appears back focused. There might have been some visual appeal had the camera been focussed on the trees on the left.",
  "color_lighting": "The file has very little colour saturation and is very flat. Even though the ambient lighting appears to be the result of an overcast day, it is still possible with good exposure and use of post production to bring contrast and colour saturation into an image.",
  "focus": "The focus in a landscape shot with short depth of field should really be in an area closer to the foreground. I feel that the focus in on the back of the lake and the trees to the left aren't sharp. I would have focussed on the trees and left the background slightly soft, or shot the landscape with a narrower depth of field (at least f11).",

  "general_impression": "Hi Bill, overall this image has a nice look and feel to it.  There are some compositional features that you may want to address in the future relative to subject placement and cropping, but overall I like the image.  Below are some things you may wish to consider in enhancing the impact of your image.  ",
  "subject_of_photo": "Bill, this is a very pleasing and colorful photo of what appear to be poppies.  Flowers, while not always the most dynamic of subject, usually, when captured well, present very well as pleasing dcor pieces and color spots for your environment.  ",
  "composition": "I like that you have chosen to move in close to the subject and render the flower large in the frame.  I think that compositionally there are some things that you could do to improve its presence however. There is a great deal of space above the flower, which itself sits at about the midline of the image and thus tends to deaden the dynamic possibilities of the image relative to movement and depth.  I do like however that despite the plethora of space above the flower, that it is populated by a very pleasing soft focus bokeh and a pleasing array of colors and soft forms. I also would have liked to have seen the entire structure of the petals of the most dominant flower.  I feel as if it is a bit cut off in the frame as it is currently cropped.   ",
  "use_of_camera": "",
  "depth_of_field": "I like the very soft background of this image.  ",
  "color_lighting": "I think the colors of this image are its strong suit.  The yellows, orange and blue combination are a classic complementary color scheme that the brain naturally looks at and says 'ahhh'.  The lighting appears to be front lighting which is good in terms of reducing shadow and contrast in an image with complexity to it, but in this case results in some color bloom in the flower and a lack of depth to the image in general (mitigated however by the nice DOF). You haven't lost highlight detail entirely because a lot of the loss of detail is from color saturation which can be reclaimed in post processing.  ",
  "focus": "I think the focus here is a bit soft.  I looked for a point of sharp focus on the flower petals of the front most subject and found it to be softer in appearance than I would expect for a close up image. This could be due to the bright bloom effect that the color of the flower has in bleeding past its point and obscuring some of the petal texture, but I suspect that you were using a very shallow depth of field (no camera data supplied so I can't be sure)and as a result the flower is just a little less than tack sharp.

It was done well but there is nothing particular about it. This could be a reason not to give 10, but than the neutral framing is what gives the subject it's strong presence, and since it is a very abstract toy doll this worked very well.

You also did this quite well in order to have a nice volumetric representation of the object.love the rendering of light in these clean and soft shapes!Also, the black background you got (would love to know if it was all done with lighting or with some software editing) and the amount of reflection on the base surface, is making it all work even better.",

You have done good with the shadows and the highlights, except the lamps but this is understandable.As for the lines this is really looking good. There are a few that feel like they are not as straight as they could but this is awesome as it is.The composition is great and the subject too, but I feel that you still need to wait for a batter moment. In this case the person is not really engaged in the scene. I will be giving you a few suggestions in this regard.Anyway, I really like the general outcome of this!Curious to see what your doing more now.Cheers",

  "general_impression": "Hi Matt,Welcome! You have a very creative view in this shot! There is loss of texture on the shadows but that is not so critical because you do have good texture on the highlights. The spot where the Sun is has been overexposed but this is acceptable since we still have plenty of cloud information there. Overall this is a good result and for most viewers this is a stunning shot. There is some loss of texture on the reflections on the water and this is also not to bad but maybe you could have a bit more texture there. You camera sure may have captured most of it if you shot RAW.For a trained eye there is maybe to much contrast and the tone is not helping to convey the power of the storm. I don't even see a storm, I just see the Sum coming through the clouds so this could be the end of a Storm.As for the work you did with taking care of the excess of light on top and the shadowed bottom, I imagine you might have used a graduated neutral density filter during the shot, because the shadows on the rocks at the bottom are great and all texturized but the shadows on the rock on the center are totally lost. This creates a problem because there is an inconsistency and the image ends up looking unrealistic. This is a problem with filter or the use of post productions techniques that resemble the work done with filters.Having said all this, I have to also say that I'm very curious to see more from you and if you are really willing to go the extra mile to get the best out of your amazing camera, I will be very happy to help you through to get to be an amazing shooter.Cheers",
  "subject_of_photo": "Very beautiful view of the sea, it reminds me of my own country (Portugal). The light coming from the Sun also creates a very special aura making this be an even more interesting subject.",
  "composition": "I like the composition very much, it's not obvious and still classic, it works and it's not boring. Well done! The format is nice too, making this look like a medium format shot, which for this camera is not far fetched.",
  "use_of_camera": "There is a slight issue with sharpness, you should investigate about diffraction limit of high res  cameras. But this shows that you know already quite a lot on how to use your camera.",
  "depth_of_field": "No need for f16 here, f11 would be enough to have it all in the field and you'd get more sharpness. Anyway, this is a good theoretical option that will give best results with most cameras.",

  "general_impression": "Warren, I think this image is quite nice and has all the elements of a presentation piece.  I don't have much in the way of criticism but I will suggest a few things that perhaps you may wish to incorporate into the post processing of this image to make it pop and bring out perhaps even more of its intrinsic beauty.",
  "subject_of_photo": "Warren, This is a marvelous image.  Although there are innumerable sunset ocean images out there, not all of them have the dynamic impact that I think this one does. There are so many interesting facets to this image that they come together, in my opinion, perfectly. ",
  "composition": "The first thing one notices in this image is the beautiful leading S-curve line of the tributary running from the left lower side of the image and meanders to the center and back to the right middle third of the frame, culminating at the surf line of the ocean.  Mirroring this line are beautifully illuminated formations that provide more organic form and texture and also solid framing and a sense of foreground to provide the viewer with perspective and scope.  The clump of grass in the foreground also creates a very nice element that both frames and provides a sort of visual anchor. Although I usually don't find a relatively central orientation of the horizon in an image, I think in this case it works very well because the elements of interest above and below the horizon are equally interesting and thus worthy of equal treatment. This is a very subtle element, but the inclusion of a single human silhouette on the left side of the image is nicely counterbalanced with the silhouette of the bird.  I think this acts to balance the image even more on a subliminal level.  I do think the horizon line is slightly canted down to the right, not particularly noticable, but just a bit.   ",
  "use_of_camera": "Everything works well here.  There are always a number of exposure, aperture and iso combinations that can work for an image.  In this case I like that you were able to use 100 ISO to minimize noise and improve image quality, in a relatively difficult and wide Dynamic tonal range environment, and still be able to use f/8 aperture and a relatively fast shutter speed of 1/125.  The exposure, while perhaps a bit mid tone heavy, contains no highlight blowout, or shadow blocking.  ",
  "depth_of_field": "The DOF here appears to be from lower frame to infinity and is appropriate to the subject.  Well done.",
  "color_lighting": "Beautiful.  The deep amber/orange tint on the clouds is reflected very effectively on the ground, specifically the water rivulet bank.  There are a lot of very nice detail elements, subtle and beautiful in the water reflections in the wide marsh area to the left of the stream, and very nice cloud reflections in the stream itself.",

At first glance, primarily because of the way you have decided to present the image as a sepia, infrared rendition, the image presents very powerfully and as I mentioned early, 'hauntingly'.  I do like the subtle play of light that is enhanced by the sepia and infrared capture and the strata of tonal areas that run horizontally through the composition, from light to dark to light to dark again.  I'm not jazzed about the cloning, healing artifacts throughout the vineyard. There are a few issues that have less to do with the color and lighting than with the post processing treatment. Since there isn't any area to address that I'll address it here.  The horizontal road area near mid center of the image is a bit bright and a little blown out I think.  Also I realize you were trying to get rid of some distracting items that were there in the vineyard rows, but the result is rather splotchy and very noticeable and probably not quite what you were going forless than I think you were going for.

I love the in-your-face composition and although there is a lot going on - it doesn't feel busy at all. In fact, it captures the raw emotion of loneliness and isolation quite well. And I think that you included just the right amount of sky. I have a few suggestions for improvement, but I don't seen any major problems as this a professionally conceived and executed image.",

  "composition": "My first reaction was that I felt the scene was a little too \"tight\" on the left side with the dock cut off right down the middle. However, after looking at your excellent image for a while I see that you were careful not to cut-off what I guess would be the boat ramp where the waves are splashing over. What I really like is how the dock in the upper third of the image is pointing directly to the boat heading off into the sunrise. The sea to sky ratio is also about perfect. Overall, this is very well done.",
  "use_of_camera": "Fantastic work. Love the .5 shutter speed - perfect for capturing both detail and motion in the waves. Great exposure. There is no evidence of noise in the shadows of the dock or in the sky. Overall, I'd say this was about as close to perfection as one could get. Well crafted Sinas!",

  "composition": "There's a good use of the rule of thirds, placing a strong silhouetted subject at the right's third. There's a negative space at the left, balancing the silhouette, good job here.But I have a little concern about the horizon line. Another rule says that we need to keep the horizon in straight position and the one that you show us here is tilted to the right. I'm not saying that this rule is static, no way, you might show photographs totally tilted, the point here is the fact that seems the horizon is tilted by mistake. Thankfully in this case works, in fact I like it tilted, just be careful a take in mind that you have to be positively aware of these rules transgressions.There's a little distracting element at the right, it looks like a branch of another bush placed nearby, placing your body better of turning the camera a little bit more to your left wold solve that in capture instances, but you can repare this very simple with a patch tool or clone tool in photoshop or any other image editing software.",
  "use_of_camera": "The image is a little bit underexposed, in other words a little bit too dark, a better knowledge of photometer usage and which areas of the scene you have to give priority is essential, you have auto exposure block buttons that are very useful when you are working wit \"P\", \"A\" or \"S\" capture programs, so a better understanding of how this option work is absolutely necesary,  I invite you to read in depth this function in your camera's manual. Also you have to understand how the photometer (light meter) programs work, if you use evaluative, spot metering, center weighted, etc. You may find this in your camera's manual too.For this photography that is in backlight, you can use an alternative choice with your camera too, using your histogram, in the capture, and manual mode, just set the aperture you want to use and later set the shutter speed slowly until you see the histogram born in the right corner, so the lights are absolutely included and bright but not clipped, no matters if you see that some shadows do not fill the histogram area and get lost, later you might adjust the shadows in your editing software using something call blacks and fill light (in adobe photoshop lightroom, for example)",

  "general_impression": "Hello Chris,Thank you for choosing me to critique your photograph. My first impression was that it was really lovely, a great silhouette of figures walking in the sunset with their dog. F:9 was a great shutter speed to choose and well done for no blur on the subject's part. There are ways to make this image go from good to excellent with a little more work in post production to make the most of the evocative mood you have already going here. I will go through these below. Well done on a great image and keep shooting!Regards,Tanya Zouev",
  "subject_of_photo": "The subject is a good one and the three figures are perfect for this type of candid yet evocative sunset image.",
  "composition": "I feel the image was shot a little far away and given you weren't shooting with a zoom, I respect you chose to capture the moment rather than run forward to get closer and potentially lose the subjects. You could crop a little tighter as there is a lot of negative space over the left of the image. The angles of the legs of the figures are perfect as is the dog. I am a major stickler for absolute dead straight horizon lines and would use a guide to make sure it is bang on instead of slightly trailing off on an angle as it is here. Of course if the image is meant to be of a hill this doesn't apply, though this image looks as though it has been shot on flat ground yet the angle is just slightly crooked in frame.",
  "use_of_camera": "Good use of exposure and speed however I would be interested to see if there was any more information in that sky or if it was blown out as the image appears very contrasty. In silhouettes it is very important to have great blacks so be sure to check your histogram.",
  "depth_of_field": "Depth of field looks good at F:9, all the figures appear to be on the same plane.",
  "color_lighting": "It would have been nice to see a little graduation in the sky perhaps some vignetting around the edges. The sky is very mono-toned, a tad too bright yellow to give the viewer a full representation of a sunset or dusk image. ",
  "focus": "It looks perfect for this image.",

Also, the sun is in the middle, did you consider putting it off to one side, and perhaps using the fence post on the other side to balance up the image? As it is, I think the shot would be improved by cropping a little off the top and off the bottom to make a panoramic format.",

Next time, try taking a series of exposures, below and above the camera's meter reading, to see what works best. The orange streak in the foreground is most probably lens flare, which is difficult to avoid in a shot like this. To minimise this, make sure your lens is very clean, try using a large aperture (i.e. f/2.8 instead of f/8) or shooting before the sun's fully above the horizon.",

Well done!The shadow on the background is strange, doesn't seem natural, and there is a clear overexposure here hence the white shirt of the violinist being over the threshold, with textureless areas in some places on the shirt and shoe laces. Other then that  I'm sure they'd love to have this shot of them performing, and they'd use it too, as it is a great representation.The contrast on this is so strong on top the his hair is indistinguishable from the shadowed background.

  "composition": "The composition is very nice. I like how you have the foliage surrounding the fawn, framing him so your eye goes right to his eye and the spots.  Unfortunately, my eye tends to jump around because of the greenery.  I do recommend to my interns to try to use the rule of thirds in their portraits, and you have the fawn right in the center.  I would try placing him off center a bit.  It would be nice if he his head were more to the right in that open area between the leaves. If you cropped in you might want to try that on the original.  I also think you could crop out some of the greenery camera left.  That large leaf is very distracting.",

There is a very hard shadow cutting through his ear which draws your eye to it, and the other shadows make the foliage look spotty and more distracting than it already is.  ",

I find it very distracting that the right eye is hidden by the leaf.  It almost looks like he is missing an eye at first. You did the right thing by making the foliage out of focus, but if it was framing his head more and his body less it would be a better portrait. ",

All great! Hard to point out things to improve here, all seems great and anyth8ing I can say will start to be a matter of taste and genre. There are a few things I can say though, there always are.I'm a sucker for good contrasty photographs and though I also appreciate soft images, I believe this would definitely benefit from more contrast. I also like it as it is and in the context of a magazine or other type of publication, where there will be writing on top of some sort, the softness is actually an advantage to keep it all nice and readable.Congrats for this shot, I really love looking at it!",

Some might consider the focal point as too centrally oriented, if you go by the 'rules' of composition that says you should place your focal point or main subject off center for interest sake.  However, there are no rules when it comes to photographic composition, merely guidelines.  In this case the placement of the terminus of the hallway in the centermost portion of the image I think draws one in more readily, and increases the power and symmetry of the composition. I like your choice to leave a goodly amount of foreground framing (wall and floor) as it gives some foundation to the image and serves as a dymanic entrance point into the composition. I also like the repetitive, yet dissimilar geometric forms from left wall to right.  The left wall is comprised of arches while the right wall is populated with rectangular door openings.  This dissonance is subtle but effective in creating some distraction from the overall strong symmetry.  ",

  "general_impression": "Hi Briggette,      So I am more curious about this bridge and why it's so special, other than the obvious beautiful light hitting it during Fall season.  You have captured the light and shadows nicely, but I want to see more. The tree branches framing the image do take away a little of my attention on the bridge, because I think it's a little too much.",
  "subject_of_photo": "Your subject here is the bridge, and how the light shines on it creating shadows and highlights through the trees.  Although it's a nice subject, it doesn't strike me as a \"wow\" image.  I feel the bridge is too dominated by the abundance of trees. I see what you are trying to convey, so I encourage you to give the bridge a little more dominate role by shooting in closer and a different angles.",
  "composition": "The placement of the bridge is good. I would have maybe brought it down an inch.  I like how you tried to frame the image with the trees, just don't frame it too much that it over-powers your subject.  Your shadows and highlights are too equal- 50/50. I would have tried to use a graduated neutral density filter.  Your eyes will always go to the whitest part of the image.  I do know there is some detail in those shadows, so be careful they do not become too black.",
  "use_of_camera": "Watch your ISO does not get too high, or it become too grainy.",
  "depth_of_field": "It might also help to blur the background.  I know those are trees, but do they have to be sharp and in focus?  What is your main subject?  That should be in focus and clear to the viewer.",

  "general_impression": "Thanks for giving me the opportunity to comment on 'Sexy Mischief', Steve.Straight from the Glamour Genre, this image certainly has many elements bringing the story together. The body pose lends itself to the Boudoir style, the directed eye contact, the thumb sucking, cleavage, bra style, underwear and bed scene all create a promise of things to come. Your timing is excellent - the moment of capture has caught the model's expression perfectly and her expression is convincingly realistic. I'm sure the shots leading up to this capture and others after, would confirm the fully story behind this shot better than I can guess.",
  "subject_of_photo": "Natasha is a delightful subject and conveys the mood of sexuality that was called for in this image. Her pose and your angle allow her to dominate the question, What are you doing down there?\", while the studs on Natasha's bra reinforce the dominating persona. 'Subdued Power' or 'Veiled Threats' could also be potential titles for this image. The fact that she is in a 'dropped kneel' position and has her head tilted down, does not make her submissive, as she is still above the shooting angle.",
  "composition": "The informal composition lends itself to the subject matter - The 'moment in time' capture could be construed as a 'personal record'(snapshot), by lovers, or as a model's glamour shoot. Attention to verticals, especially in the case of the alcove/doorway that acts as a natural frame could be considered. The model's hand leading into the foreground is not oversized, as the majority of the model is on the same plane, and the choice of lens hasn't distorted her proportions.",
  "use_of_camera": "Without full metadata, I would be foolish to comment too technically, but the 'Biorhythm' of ISO/Aperture/Shutter have their crossovers within that safe zone, with the possible exception of the model's left hand. A smaller aperture may have captured more detail there, if the primary focus had been moved forward from eyes to nose tip (for example.)  ",
  "depth_of_field": "A great deal of care must be taken with using a lens near it's maximum aperture (especially when that aperture can be f1.2). The model's left hand is leaving the acceptable depth of field, where it could have been a major emotive focal point. ",
  "color_lighting": "The High Key effect achieved in this mono conversion conveys the freshness of the sheets, the 'wholesomeness of the sexuality' and forces us to examine the dark contrasts for detail. The whites have blown out, which is fairly common in mono conversions until full control is taken of that process.",
  "focus": "The alcove/doorway is delightfully soft, giving the feeling of a room, without the crowding hindrance of furnishings. The primary areas of interest, eyes, face, hair, bust and right hand are all adequately covered.",
  "description": "With Natasha looking down at me from this angle, I wanted to convey a sense of mischief as she appeared to me to wonder \"what are you down there for? I'm up here in bed waiting...\"I lost the metadata to this pic along the way but do rec            ",

  "general_impression": "John, This is a very nicely composed image.  There are some areas of color casting, and noise and perhaps artifacting that you might consider addressing that are probably part of the technique you used incorporating two versions of the image one at HDR/Tone-mapped as I understand.  Here are some specifics for your consideration.    ",
  "subject_of_photo": "John,  This is a very nice action image.  I like it very much.  It is difficult to decide how to approach this critique as I already know that this is an image that has been worked to a fairly good degree.  I like this images mood and feel of motion and energy.  ",
  "composition": "I like your choice of cropping the image in a portrait orientation.  The diagonal placement of the surfers both on the wave and in relation to each other, creates a more dynamic feel than a more horizontal placement.  Also the portrait orientation drives the action from top to bottom and the feel is one of dynamic motion moving down the wave towards the viewer.  Having seen the original however, I know that there is a very nice and powerful curve shape along the entire top crest of the wave extending to the right of the topmost surfer that is not visible in this image.  It is nice enough a shape to consider other crops to incorporate it.",
  "use_of_camera": "The shutter speed was more than sufficient to capture the action, and the aperture was wide at 4.5.  And you used a great lens to capture this image.  I'm not sure what the conditions were at your shooting site, but your ISO of 1600, while perhaps necessary to keep your shutter speed high enough for this shot, results in a considerable amount of color noise in the smooth areas of the image.  But I can't slight you for it not knowing the lighting conditions at the time.  Perhaps a tripod might have helped you some here. It appears that you used a spot metering and I'm thinking, guessing actually, that you metered off the darker water or the surfers wet suits considering there is detail there and the water spray and foam are somewhat blown out detail wise in the original.  I think that spot metering was a good way to go here.  Bringing back highlight detail I think is easier in this case than trying to resurrect blocked shadows in your surfers.   ",
  "depth_of_field": "",
  "color_lighting": "I like the painterly effect of this image, close up or viewed at a smaller magnification, the image has the look of an art piece and not so much a photo.  I like this.  The image is, perhaps purposefully, casted towards Cyan, particularly in the water spray and foam areas.  I like the treatment of the background water which has a very mottled, painted effect.  There is a considerable amount of red/green color noise throughout the image.  See the surfers faces and the water and spray areas.  I feel like some of the colors, particularly on the surfers faces are a bit over cooked and unnatural.  Not sure why. . could be over saturation, or a result of some of the filtering you did when you worked the image.  ",
  "focus": "Looks acceptable.  I don't have a full resolution image to review, and and I know that some processing was done. But it looks ok to me. ",

The semi-profile view helps to show the form and shape of the subject. Background is not distracting. With the bird in the middle of the composition the image is static and lacks energy. Since the bird is looking slightly to the right placing if further to the left in the composition could have been more effective.",

There is not a \"pop\" to the image due to the flat tonal range. There are dark tones, but few very light tones. I would look to lighten the light tones to improve the tonal range and overall appearance of the image. Also the left side of the bird's face is in the shade causing the eye to be very dark. Selective lightening that side of the face could bring out better detail in the eye.",

Cropping either by the original or by cropping after needs some attention,I suggest to always leave room arround the shot when shooting. This can be by a min. so not to  capture to much, but enough to adjust later in adobe. the crop at the top needs a little more room for the buildings to breathe, and the crop on the fight side  has cut of the last building . depth is great  which is complimented by the lead vehicle lights coming in from the right lower side , giving a three dimentional effect.

  "general_impression": "Hi Dennis,Like yourself, I really enjoy photographing birds in flight.  It is a tremendous challenge and when you get a good one it is really enjoyable.For me, this image suffers from problems with the composition (the bird too close to the left side of the frame), a perspective problem where we can't see the bird's eye and a bit of a problem with the exposure where it looks like it was originally over exposed a bit.But, you nailed the focus and your depth-of-field looks perfect.  Use my Three P's of Photography; Practice, Practice, Practice and you'll be nailing all the technical aspects in no time at all.I look forward to seeing more of your work.Best regards,Paul",
  "subject_of_photo": "Birds in flight are definitely a compelling subject.  ",
  "composition": "The composition in this image doesn't really work for me.  The bird is too tight to the left side of the frame.  Generally we'd like to be able to see the bird's eye as well as it is the eyes that tell the story and help viewers of your images connect to the subject.",
  "use_of_camera": "It s hard to tell for sure at this resolution but it appears that some of the white areas on the bird are over exposed with a loss of detail.  I suspect the dark background of the water fooled your camera's sensor into over exposing the image.  The camera's metering system always wants to make a scene average out to an 18% middle tone.  The dark water there probably fooled the camera's metering system which cause the camera to overexpose the image.",
  "depth_of_field": "Depth-of-field looks great.",
  "color_lighting": "The color in the image seems fine.  The lighting looks like mid-afternoon light to me and that is rarely the best light of the day for photographing a subject like this as it is a very harsh light.",
  "focus": "Focus appears to be very well done.",

There are a few issues and I will only point out some, because going through all of them would take a long time and would give a long text, which is not the format here in Gurushots.Having said this, and hoping you found my suggestions helpful, I'm curious to see more from you, on the same or other genera.Cheers",

Although I like the blue, it's the flowers that are most important. I think you have placed the camera lower down but I would have liked it lower still, perhaps almost on the ground.",
  "use_of_camera": "1/200 sec is a good choice - flowers tend to move all the time, even on days which are virtually still, so you need a fairly fast shutter speed to freeze the movement. The focal length was 100 mm which I think puts you a bit far away from your subject. I would have used 50 mm or less. Color balance is on the cool side - I would have liked to have seen it warmed up a bit - perhaps a bit more work in Elements?  ",
  "depth_of_field": "Lovely! Nice hazy sky but we can still see clouds. Perhaps a slightly smaller aperture to enhance the blur in the mid ground and blur a few of the flowers furthest back... just my  thoughts, you may have intended something different but I think it would have been more poetic.",

  "general_impression": "Jose, I think you've done a good job of capturing the snake in a characteristic pose. Catching the fully extended tongue gives the viewer an insight into the way that snakes monitor their environment. We can see the muscular coiled body is ready to strike if the snake is threatened or needs to catch some prey. However, because of the upward angle of the snake's gaze, it appears that this one is under threat and defensive.  So your photograph is telling us some of the snake's story.I've already mentioned that I like snakes, so this image doesn't make me feel uneasy. I feel admiration for the predator. But some viewers may feel otherwise. Eliciting reactions from viewers is a worthy goal of any photographer.I think the photograph's strongest attributes are the composition and your control of DoF. I mentioned previously that I feel it's too bright overall, and I think that if you consider my suggestions below the image can be strengthened as a wildlife portrait with more expression.Thanks for choosing me to critique your image, Jose. I wish you all the best with your photography.If it moves you, shoot it!Rob Smith AAPS",
  "subject_of_photo": "The snake is dominant in the frame and bound to catch the viewer's attention, whether out of admiration or abhorrence! Some people shudder at the thought of a venomous snake, others are intrigued. I'm in the latter group. Having a degree in Zoology makes me interested in all kinds of animals. ",
  "composition": "Your image is dynamic with those diagonal lines through the snake's head and coils. There's an overall dynamic of lines leading from lower left to top right, culminating in the extended forked tongue that's reaching out to the corner. I also like the serpentine curves.The composition of the snake is triangular and that appeals to me. The bulk of the snake's body makes up the base of the triangle and, fittingly, the head forms the apex. A small mountain of snake!The photograph is tightly framed and your PoV (point of view) was low to bring the viewer down to the snake's level. Good.",
  "use_of_camera": "1/1250th @ f7.1 & 500mm ISO 400 AE Nikon D90You've used a super telephoto lens at its maximum stretch and at almost its widest aperture, and also used a moderate ISO rating to assist a fast shutter. All of these choices combine to tell me that you know what you're doing with the camera controls! The wide aperture has created a pleasing out of focus foreground and background to isolate the snake's head from what could have otherwise been detailed distraction in the background. The fast shutter has not only arrested the movement of the snake's tongue, it has minimised the chance of camera shake spoiling your image. Well done, Jose. And smart work as wellthe super telephoto lens kept you a safe distance from the serpent!Exposure looks OK. You've captured a wide dynamic range without clipping highlights or shadows. Overall, however, I think the image would look better if it wasn't as bright.",
  "depth_of_field": "The DoF looks great! The most important parts of the snake are in the zone of acceptable focus and the rest of the image is prevented from becoming too much of a distraction. I like the way that part of the snake's body exits the frame along the bottom border. It leaves me to ponder how much closer the rest of the body may be approaching the viewer out of frame. Overall, the image has a good three dimensional appearance.",
  "color_lighting": "The photograph looks to have been captured in sunny conditions with no artificial light fill. That's par for the course in wildlife photography. The colour balance looks natural. Shadows, while quite dark, are in keeping with the bright conditions. Softer modelling light would have created a more pleasing portrait, perhaps, but, nevertheless, the hard light and shadows work OK for a dangerous reptilian subject. We don't think of snakes as 'soft'.",
  "focus": "The most important part of the snake, head and eye, is in focus with the rest of the image bleeding away to markedly out of focus in the foreground and background. That's appropriate for a wildlife portrait.",

It's like a crutch that one can use to make sure that the punctuation of the photograph will be clear and easy to read.My only issue here is just really the fact that your composition is including to much of that dark area on the background, taking a bit of the softness from her.

This is an important wildlife composition element.  2. You are at eye level with the peacock, allowing the legs to be in full view.  You are in the peacock's world at eye level. 3. There are no distracting elements in the frame; the grass and the tree on the right are complementary. What Could Be Improved: 1. Physically back up to include the tips of the birds feathers.  If you're positioned on the ground, it may require using a wider angle lens (i.e., less than 50mm)to capture all of the feathers in the frame.2. Try for opportunities to get a female peacock in the foreground in the photo with the male in the background, showing his display.  Then it tells a story!",
  "use_of_camera": "With wildlife photography, the most important elements are freezing the action, getting the subject's eyes in sharp focus and other key features (in this photo, the feathers) in sharp focus.  If you were handholding your camera, then with the shutter speed at only 1/50s, you were lucky to have gotten the peacock eyes tack sharp.  Also with wildlife photography (and unlike landscape photography), we are willing to increase ISO to get more light, to enable higher shutter speeds.Suggested settings next time:  Aperture Priority, f/7.1-f/8, ISO 800-1000.  Watch to get minimum shutter speed of at least 1/focal length of your lens or 1/250s for your lens.",
  "depth_of_field": "Your f-stop and the focal length of your lens drive the degree of depth of field in the photo.  Your focal length of 80mm and f-stop of f/5.6 provided enough depth of field to get the eyes, body and some parts of the feathers in focus.  A smaller aperture would have yielded even more and maybe all of the feather features to be in sharp focus.",
  "color_lighting": "What You did Well: 1. The colors look correct.  Auto white balance worked in this situation (although I generally do not use auto white balance)2. The time of days looks to be mid-day, but perhaps a hazy day, yielding a relatively few shadows.Post Processing Suggestion:1.  Saturate, increase contrast and extract detail in the feathers.  Photoshop Elements should provide you with the tools to do this.",

  "general_impression": "Hello Lukas.  As I said earlier this is a wonderful and strikingly colorful image of an otherwise static and mundane subject. Understand that telephone poles, unless they are uniquely lit, and placed into the composition in a way that either borders another geometric shape like, for instance, a railroad track disappearing into the horizon, or a desert road, are for the most part. . simply telephone poles.  Nonetheless I fully understand why you captured this image.  I would have too.  If you were capturing this image to show others the magnificent sunset and to share with them that magical moment, then your mission was well accomplished.  If you were shooting this image as a candidate for perhaps a hanging photo behind a couch, then you have to ask yourself if the subject (aside from the trees) is something you'd want to look at for any length of time.  Again, a matter of subjective taste. No matter.  The image is striking and interesting just from the colors and cloud formation you have captured.  ",
  "subject_of_photo": "Hello Lukas,  Thanks again for sharing your image with me.  This image has a couple of subjective quality components to it that I'll address today.  First it is a striking photo simply because of the lighting and the drama that the color and formation of the clouds has created for you. To me the image is striking but the foreground, which by defacto sometimes becomes the subject simply because of its proximity to you, is not particularly interesting.  While it does provide the viewer with a frame of reference and serves as a point from which to determine the scope of the scene, it is after all simply some trees and a telephone pole.  Having said this, I'll also say that I've shot my share of these over the years simply because I was drawn to the spectacular imagery that was provided by the sunset or sunrise. You aren't always in the best place to capture that sunset with an iconic foreground to balance it out. ",
  "composition": "Notwithstanding the subject, the forms and shapes within your image are balanced and well placed.  The lighting of the clouds is well done and shows off the layers and depth of the sky wonderfully. I think the way the image is cropped also works well. I suppose you could consider cropping a bit of the left side frame of the image but then you would lose some of the cloud edge and length, and thus change the sense of expanse of space that the sky creates behind the foreground.  This image could have benefitted from a view where the foreground traveled less side to side than foreground to background, and thus allowed perhaps the telephone pole wires to move into the image rather than across it.  But again, you may not have had the advantage of easily maneuvering to that place in the scene where that was possible. ",
  "use_of_camera": "You weren't using a tripod so you must have a steady hand. I see too that you were using the F/8 aperture setting which for this lens (I love this lens by the way) is right in the sweet spot for depth of field and sharpness.  I also see you were using the lens at its highest telescopic setting of 105mm.  It would have been a lot safer, and considering you weren't using a tripod, to have used a faster shutter speed. ",
  "depth_of_field": "The depth of field works fine for this image.  ",
  "color_lighting": "The colors and hues are the most compelling part of this image. If there were no foreground this would be a wonderful candidate for your 'cloud' collection, perhaps to be used for future sky replacements on images that are devoid of sky and need a pumping up.  You accomplished I think what you wanted in capturing the sky at that moment when it was probably at its apex of color and contrast.  Good job.  ",

  "general_impression": "Hi Ray!For a beginner photographer I must say you're up there turning the curve. I haven't seen more from you so it's early to make an appreciation, but this shot is really good.The contrast of light between the dark cloudy sky and the railing is really enjoyable and it gets even more powerful with the subtle vignetting. It's a visible vignetting, it could be more subtle, but it works perfectly here!Then the grasses out of focus making the railing look sharp without you having to over-sharpen it. Seriously, this is really a good result, even it was beginners luck, this is a great breakthrough in the way you have dealt with different shapes and textures. The horseman didn't even need to be there, but of course, the play a major role for all this to work perfectly.Well done!This is definitely a photograph worth working further on it to make it be perfect!Congrats!I really look forward to see more from you!Cheers",
  "subject_of_photo": "This is a great subject! It's even a better subject than having a horse running on the shot, because that would be that and that's it. This is much more than that. This is story telling. You talk about the leisure or the moment and this is present, of course, but I see more. They are racers that could be talking about achievements or issues to improve. They have protection vests so we can imagine them racing, before or after this moment. Looks like it's a guy and a gal and he is leaning towards her as if he is teaching her. He has perfect posture but she is a bit curved and this could mean many things, lack of practice or emotional stress... the possibilities are endless. He seems to have a camera on his helmet too and this suggests further that he might be her instructor. The differences between the two are quite big! And the horses show these differences too. This is the sort of photograph that deserves all the attention and care to detail.",
  "composition": "Top execution! It's not bold and new but it's also not bland, it's a classic very well done composition. This angle is awesome, if you had a higher stand point it would not work as good.",

  "depth_of_field": "Just perfect! Couldn't be better.",
  "color_lighting": "There is a slight inconsistency between the railing and the grey sky, indicating that this could be a sunset light on the railing but not on the sky. The railing is quite warm but the sky doesn't show that. Anyway, this situation do occur naturally. There is also an over-exposure on the railing but this is due to the strong sunlight being strongly reflected. Not easy to go around this in the shooting.",

Or you Isolate which means you zoom right in on the subject and focus on just the action leaving out the other parts of the scene. Thats what you did here and this subject warrants that approach. The ducks are mating and that's the story. ",

  "general_impression": "Hi, Mary. Thanks for giving me \"Granite\" to critique. You stated above that your intention was to \"bring out colour, texture and pattern\" in the rock face. It's always good to really think about your intention before you lift the camera to your eye (\"Why am I taking this photograph? What do I want my photograph to say or suggest to the audience?\"). Doing so will help you focus on and frame what is important in order to realise your intentyour visualisation for the imageYour stated goal for this image has been met, in my opinion.I can imagine this as a good candidate for a large canvas or mural in a home or corporate office. It's what I sometimes call a designer image: one that contributes to the overall decor of a man-made space.The overall quality and appeal of the image is good as it stands. So my suggestions for improvement are, again, ideas that you might consider to finesse your execution or simply create and evaluate different treatments.Kind regards,Rob Smith AAPS",
  "subject_of_photo": "The subject matter is interesting from the point of view that it's a semi-abstract picture of a small part of a bigger landscape. The viewer immediately thinks \"What is it?\" when it comes into view. Telling a part of the story, with a snippet of the whole, can often be more interesting than the big picture. This is one such example.",
  "composition": "There is no strong compositional design here. It's a busy scene showcasing the colours and texture of a geological formation. When we view the image with squinted eyes we see that it's amorphous: no prominent leading lines; no macro shapes of light and shade; no obvious point of interest on which the eye will come to dwell. Does that mean it should score low for 'Composition and perspective'?I don't think so! There is a strong impression of the complexity of the small shapes in the rocks and the variety of hues. And the texture is almost palpable. So I like those aspects of the image enough to score it well.Nevertheless, when presented with an opportunity such as this scene, always be on the lookout for actal or implied shapes that could be exploited.",
  "use_of_camera": "1/30the @ f7.1 & 120mm ISO 200There is a relatively low dynamic range in the scene you've photographed (no harsh highlights or black shadows) so getting the correct exposure to adequately render all parts of the scene would have been easy. You've used your zoom lens at full stretch (120mm) and this has had two effects: (a) flattening the perspective  (which can aid an abstract image); and (b) limiting the depth of field at the moderate aperture of f7.1.Had you wished to render the whole of the image in the adequate depth-of-field zone, you could have used a shorter focal length (with inherently greater depth of field) and moved closer to the subject to include the same area in the frame whilst, at the same time, choosing a smaller aperture such as f8 or f11. The shorter focal length would allow you scope to use a slower shutter hand-held to compensate for the smaller aperture. This may have allowed you to include the foot of the image in the adequate depth-of-field zone. But, if you couldn't easily get close to the subject, the point I've made above is academic!",
  "depth_of_field": "The moderate aperture of f7.1 has included most of the image within the acceptable depth of field. As mentioned above, the foot of the image extends into out-of-focus territory. While this slightly blurred area can be considered to give the image a sense of depth, I question whether it adds any real value.Alternatively, a tripod (I know you own one!) would have allowed you to shoot at 120mm with a narrower aperture and slower shutter speed to achieve correct exposure and better DoF at that focal length. Whether or not you'd achieve enough improvement to render the foot of the image in focus I can only guess. Worth a try next time.",
  "color_lighting": "There is no reference point of a known colour, for example whitewater as in your waterfall image, or a patch of blue sky. So the question of whether or not the image is faithfully rendered in a white-balance or colour balance sense does not need to be answered. It's an image for which you could freely alter the colour balance in order to come up with a palette of colours that pleases your eye.I like the colour palette presented. The hints of blue are complementary to the oranges and yellows. And the sheen on some facets of the fragments of rock enhances the impression that this rock face is dampnot only saturated with colour but with mist!",
  "focus": "The majority of the image is in sharp focus with fine detail rendered. A shelf-like area protruding closer to the camera is outside the zone of sharp focus. ",

  "general_impression": "Hi Terry,  You've created a very nice image, perfectly suited for an enlargement and printing for either wall art or a gallery print. I normally do not give ratings of 10 across the board simply because it doesn't leave much room for improvement.  However in this case, any critiques I have are very subjective, and based upon my own personal tastes (see below). I think the image can be presented in many ways and the exposure, and other technical details of this image are done very well which ironically allows you to post process this image using many different values and approaches. Good work.",

  "composition": "I like the composition of this image.  Filling the frame with wildlife is, to me, always preferable if you can do it.  I'm not sure what telephoto length you were using but it worked well in this case. Diagonal leading lines sometimes don't work well, but with birds, roads and fences they do and the use of them here is appropriate and pleasing to the eye. The eye is drawn into the image and can be held there for some time by the curvilinear S-curve line of the neck and the solitary bright eye. Then the composition also allows for the eye to move seamlessly off the page as well. The background is dark and softly focused with sufficient detail which brings the heron well into the foreground and provides some contrast and dimension. ",
  "use_of_camera": "It would be difficult to critique the settings you chose since the image is well exposed and focused sharply. I see you used F/8 as your aperture which is usually a good safe sweet spot when shooting, and allowed you to use a fast shutter speed that was quite capable of capturing the image with no movement or blurring. It also allowed you to shoot without a tripod.  A tripod, while inconvenient, will always provide more clarity and sharpness of your image however.",

  "color_lighting": "The lighting, colors, shadows are all very nicely conveyed in this image. The lighting is sufficient to capture the feather texture and tonal variations in the plumage.

  "subject_of_photo": "Hello again Lynn! I really like this picture with its startling green colour and terrific rhythms throughout. The subject is clear and eye-catching. I would not put it under the genre of 'photojournalism' really as it is not a news item but think that documentary or even still-life would be more appropriate categories.",
  "composition": "Good angle and fairly good perspective although I think if you had been slightly closer you could have lost the wonky post on the right! This kind of distortion is difficult to avoid with a wide angle however and even so could be corrected in image editing software to make it straight. But what's great about this shot are the many rhythms that echo throughout the foreground and on into the middle ground and the background.",

You have a very good eye to foresee what and where to shoot and generally compose  families that have very good impact, and impact is the very first thing that  judging is used to score prints in competition. Very well done Kimberly !!!",
  "subject_of_photo": "Kimberly,  what a pleasent suprize, your family portrait is the best  submission I have seen since being accepted by guru shots !!  I thankyou for selecting me to critique your work and I will sink my teeth into this and enjoy . Overall  you have captured a family portrait with flow and some animation with  natural smiles and have placed them agaisnt a good overall backgraound location.",
  "composition": "Kimberly, Iam going to give you a long critique filled with information and helpful suggestions , so bare with me ok. Overall Kimberly, there are only three problem areas. first placement of your subject is very well done, being they are framed by the blue gate and centered by the \"v\" rail excellent ! The postion of the girls on the right and center are excellent again especailly with the leg and feet position this is excuted beautifully and correct !! the older girl on the left should be positioned more inward to the center girl and the weight of her body should be on the right leg not the left with the knee slighly bent like the other two girls. and maybe her hand on her hip.and her head should be tilted to her left in towards the center.you have created on the good side as well a foregound, middleground and background wellsone htere. this creates the depth that is needed. contrast is good  and leading lines from the gate also helps frame the girls well. The camera angle however is wrong  the camera should be level  in most family if not all portraits, because by tilting the angle here makes them seem like they are falling to the left out of the frame. Remember to keep the angle level, I know it might add  flavour and style, but better horizontally framed.",
  "use_of_camera": "kimberly, you possess a very good camera that will serve you well , however please note as mentioned above the f stops to try and start to use in portraiture for great depth and sharpness. The Iso of 1000 is not the best iso of 1oo is ideal. having said that I have produced  award winning portraits using  iso 1000 on film giving a grainy speckled effect, and with digital settings  it will give you contrast and softer skin tones as you have produced whcih may have been you intent, in this case I like the end product. But use it sparingly ok. the focal length of 21  works ok , however  try for  a longer focal length closer to 55 , it will make you move a little bck but give you a better perspective, just a small note on this.",
  "depth_of_field": "Althought you have used f 3.5  the depth being close in including the background seemed to work ok in this shot, as mentioned above f 5.6  or f 8 will give you better control on the sharpness without taking away from any other of the elements.",
  "color_lighting": "the overall colour is rich with a soft tone which I perfer, and good contrast to finish off. well done here kimberly ! One main note is the top colours, the pant tones of a dark anture are bang on !  however have your cliental select solid dark tones  tops so the eye stays focused to the faces and not be mesmerize by the hot colours and patterns.",
  "focus": "kimberly, the file size is well selected  and the focus seems good, which help on the shrpness overall of the portrait, but I would suggest in the future for all portraits use min f 5.6  and up to f 13 , the middle being f 8 this will ensure a slower shutter speed to give more detail but most important to ensure sharp focus of your subject matter , in this case ofcourse the faces.",

  "general_impression": "I think this spider is interesting.  A tighter shot on the spider would draw the viewer in more.  The background takes away from the spider and it is always beneficial if your subject fills 1/3 or more of the frame.",
  "subject_of_photo": "The subject is good, but the light colored background makes the subject very difficult to see.  With a dark background a spider of this color would stand out much more to the viewer.  A dark green leaf, or something with a single color would help the shades of colors on the spider stand out more.",
  "composition": "This image seems like it is upside down.  It doesn't suck the viewer in because it is almost difficult to find the orientation of the spider.  If the image was flipped on the vertical access the image might draw the viewer in more.",
  "use_of_camera": "The photo is slightly under exposed.  Built in camera meters will tend to under expose images that are mainly white or yellow.",
  "depth_of_field": "A narrower depth of field on the subject would also help draw the viewer into the spider.  The exif data wasn't available, but if the image was taken at f5.6, f4 or f2.8 would create a narrower depth of field on the spider and remove some of the distraction from the background.",
  "color_lighting": "Again the background could have been better to highlight this subject.  Separating your subject and drawing the viewer into the image is key goal.  The color of the background and the color of the subject being similar sort of blends them together and makes it difficult for the viewer to get drawn into the subject.",

  "general_impression": "Hello Al. I really enjoyed this photo. I myself am a car lover, and also enjoy the featuring of the beautiful design of different feature of stylish cars. This was a very creative and imaginative idea to feature this part of the vehicle. I know that of you use the suggestions I have listed, that this would make a great photo hanging on someones wall, or in the show room of a car dealer. Great work Al!",
  "subject_of_photo": "The direction you were going with this photo is very creative. I like the concept of taking a beautifully designed car wheel, and trying to feature it against a lighter color is exactly what photography is all about. I have seen photos like this hanging on walls in car dealers and offices. You are on the right track. ",
  "composition": "You were on the right track as far as getting the angle of the wheel, and floor. What would have made the shot pop even more, would be capturing the wheel more from the left. You could have gotten more of the wheel and rim in the shot, which would have really magnified the curves and detailed design of the rim along with tire itself. The lighting reflected on the floor is a bit distracting, but could have changed with a different angle. Also, cropping it more so the left shadows and reflection is no longer in the shot. The idea is to feature the wheel and front end of the car against the white of the floor. ",
  "use_of_camera": "I will give you an 8 for this because I know that it is sometimes difficult to judge when looking at an LCD screen. Just as a suggestion to make it better. Slower speed, to allow more light in which will also help with bringing more detail out of the wheel. You can always use use a contrast adjuster in post processing to bring down some of the blow out that may show up on the floor. ",
  "depth_of_field": "This is perfect. You were able to capture the wheel, as well as feature the line of the car with complete clarity. I like how the front wheel is lighter, and the contrast becomes darker as it follows to the back. This is what really makes it stand out.",
  "color_lighting": "The color is perfect. When trying to keep with the natural element of the object, you do not want to enhance the color to much. I would maybe enhance the vibrancy and saturation just a little using Lightroom or something similar. Other then that, the showroom lighting really helps with this capture.",
  "focus": "The reason I give you a 5 for this, is when working with a object close up, you want to capture as much detail and sharpness you can get. I know you did not use a tripod, and it looks like you used a point and shoot, which means you were probably looking through the LCD screen. I would recommend a mini tripod which will allow you to get closer to the floor as well as prevent and movement and capture the beautiful details of the tire and the car. ",

  "general_impression": "Hi Deigh!  It certainly looks like the perfect morning out there in the high desert of Oregon (a simply lovely place of solitude and ample untapped photo opportunities).  You've done a great job retaining the color in the sky and detail in the foreground in a challenging exposure situation.  Your image also conveys a nice sense of depth because of the various layers you've included. You're on the right track - just a couple minor adjustments on composition and exposure and you'll be on your way!",
  "subject_of_photo": "You've successfully rendered and clearly communicated your vision of blooming rabbit brush beneath a colorful morning sky.  There's little to distract from this primary subject/message...if anything, there may be some excess you could eliminate on either side.  See my comments on composition.",
  "composition": "Because you've included multiple layers - the foreground yellow bush, midground field, and sky in the background, the image conveys an effective sense of depth and space.The middle placement of the rabbit brush on the edge of the frame makes the shape more visually static and pulls the viewer's eye out of the frame.  For a more dynamic asymmetrical feel, try to position the bush off-centered to the left or right.  OR to emphasize the relationship between the blooming rabbit brush and the beautiful sky in the background, a tighter vertical orientation may have been more effective as this format would eliminate a lot of the extra \"stuff\" on either side of the bush and colorful clouds.  For this frame, I'd recommend cropping into a square format The horizon line is approaching the middle of the frame, so the overall feel to the image feels symmetrical even though symmetry doesn't exist.  This confuses the viewer - should we look as the sky or the land?  Which is more important?  If it's the sky, tilt your camera up higher towards the sky and drop the horizon towards the bottom third of the frame.  If it's the land, tilt your camera down towards the field and raise the horizon towards the top third of the frame.  If it's both, get physically lower (drop your tripod down) and eliminate more of the midground.The lines radiating from the sky serve as visual pathways, especially at the top of the frame.  But the lack of lines and strong dominant visual objects beyond the yellow rabbit brush in the landscape means we don't see a lot of movement in the bottom third of the image.",
  "use_of_camera": "Wind is a reality out there in the high desert.  While I'm not certain if you had wind or not while photographing this scene, impressively, your shutter speed, ISO speed, and aperture settings allowed you to render extensive depth of field while keeping the flowering field frozen.  Well done!",
  "depth_of_field": "",
  "color_lighting": "The white balance for the frame looks great - not too orange, not too blue.  Even though it's subtle and indirect, we still see a contrast between highlight (on the left) and shadow (on the right) which helps convey a sense of depth and dimension across your entire scene.  Nice positioning of your camera to tap into shaping side light during the morning.Although the foreground looks properly exposed, the sky looks unnaturally underexposed, especially when compared to the foreground.  If you utilized a graduated neutral density filter to hold back the light in the sky and retain the color, I'd recommend using a slightly less intense filter strength (about a stop of light less) and positioning a little closer to the horizon (so the field isn't as dark).  You can easily adjust for this during your post-processing, where I'd recommend lightening at least the middle ground field and perhaps even the sky a touch so the lighting looks more even.That said, the indirect diffused lighting brings out richer yellows, greens, and browns in the landscape.  The rising sun helps to provide added drama with the pinks and blues in the sky.",
  "focus": "Everything from the blooming rabbit brush to the distant clouds are in focus.  Depth of field looks spot on for this landscape scene.",

The water droplets add so much to the image overall and the diffused lighting allows the bold colors of the flower to stand out against the dark background.

  "subject_of_photo": "The subject is clearly defined and there are minimal distractions. The water droplets add interest to the flower.",

For visual balance it's important that one flower is dominant and the other is secondary - and you've accomplished this very well. However, the partial flower in the top left corner is a distraction. Also watch the edges of the image. Generally speaking for something along an edge don't cut it off at all, or cut off enough to show you meant to cut it off. With that in mind, the petal at the top is too close to the top edge (cut it off or leave more space) and the petal at the bottom is not cut off enough.",

  "general_impression": "Hello Barry ~This is a very striking image.  I would love to know where this was taken, and what other animals you encountered on your drive!  Nature provides us the most lovely colors and patterns, if one takes a moment to look, there is art everywhere in the natural world. You certainly have captured a work of art here - I hope its framed on your wall!  You seem to have a great eye for composition, get your camera's manual out and start diving into all manual shooting.  (If you haven't already).  Your creativity is limitless if you become proficient shooting manual, and you have a great camera - the sky's the limit on what you can do!",
  "subject_of_photo": "Stripes!  I love the expression on the foals face, sweet, he appears to be inquisitive and playful! A simple head shake to get relief from bugs, can turn into a photographers prize image!",
  "composition": "Very nice job framing here, I like the fact that the foliage just behind the Zebra's gently slopes across the top 1/3 of the frame, eye to eye perspective - all of your elements work perfectly here!",
  "use_of_camera": "Your shutter speed at 320 is not quite fast enough to stop the motion of the foals head in mid-shake.  ",
  "depth_of_field": "The Zebra's are nicely defined against the landscape, even at F7.1.  The distance between the zebras and the background is certainly great enough to give a soft blur (bokeh) to the landscape in the distance.  ",
  "color_lighting": "With the white balance set to auto, and the exposure program set to landscape, there are a lot of cool tones in this image.  I would like to see the white of the zebras depicted as white, and not slightly blue.  Using a landscape mode with many camera's, you get a sharper image, and the blues and greens are accentuated...for the obvious reason of sky and foliage enhancement.  It just makes things a little more difficult when there is an element in your image that doesn't benefit from the blue and green boost.",
  "focus": "Your focus looks good here, for the blurred head of the foal, we'll address shutter speed in the next section.",

  "subject_of_photo": "Hi Lucas. I like the whimsical nature of your image. As a presentation image it works pretty well in that your original intent was to display varieties of plums I assume. As an art piece it is less effective, but could be with a few tweaks here and there.  ",
  "composition": "For your purposes stated in the information section, the composition is straightforward and works fine to display your items with space for text.  I think visually it is just fair in that there are a considerable number of distracting lines and forms that distract from your row of plums. I think the background could be less obtrusive as it contains enough detail and form to render your foreground less striking.  The composition is primarily horizontal in orientation yet there are some lines that move vertically that once again break up the continuity.  I refer mainly to the soft gray pole in the background behind the next to last plum.  Additionally I think that the space under the table would be more balanced if it were not visible, either under the table nor to the right of the table leg.  It feels a little as if your composition is about to roll off the table to the right.  ",

  "subject_of_photo": "Hi again Elizabeth...WOW, you're on a roll! As I look at your image I also wonder what he is thinking and what he is looking at. Maybe his hand is there because he just can't reach that itchy spot on his back and he's cranky. Maybe he's thinking about the great Gulab Jamun he had for dessert at the restaurant last night and he's considering returning for more.He (i.e. your subject) is clearly defined although I find he is overbearing. In this situation I would have backed away from him to put him further into the thirds and to also isolate him in his environment a bit more. I see no reason to be so close because any part of him that may be of interest to me is facing the other way. The hand is a bit distracting and my eyes are drawn to it. Your other two images were stronger.",

His head is a bit too close to the center for my liking but the fact that his hand is there, in the thirds and in focus, adds some interest to your shot thus drawing my attention back to the left-hand thirds.

Band and musician portrait photography is a difficult subject and you've done really well overall. If you particularly enjoy photographing them, with some refining you could improve your photography immensely.",

  "composition": "The composition is good, I like the staggered style of posing with the (presumably) headman at the front with the other two lined up side by side in the back. The perspective is good, the subjects are ever slightly higher than the lens which works for this particular portrait. I am finding that the image is cropped too much over the subject's heads, I would have given them a little more room.",

Firstly the backlighting whilst very effective has run too much onto the man's face and hair on the far left rendering it pure white with no information.

  "general_impression": "I nice capture that grabs your attention and keeps it long enough to have your eyes start exploring the details in the feathers. It also  has a geometric  element if you look at it abstractly  with the way the feathers radiate out.  As often the case with small animals, getting lower and at their eye level adds impact to the image and presents your viewer  with an angle they do not often see.  The monochrome/limited color pallet of this image can lead to some creative treatments such as black and white, high constrast, or pushing an even greater color contrast. Play around and see what you can create. ",
  "subject_of_photo": "A very good choice of subject caught at a lucky moment. ",
  "composition": "I like how you have not centered the bird's head and allowed the feathers to create a nice radial / diagonal leading line pointing to the birds head. However,  I would have loved to see this shot done from a lower position.  Had you shot this from a lower stance, you would have caught the bird eye to eye or been looking slightly up at it, both of which would have added much impact to the composition.",
  "use_of_camera": "The  exposure is a tiny bit dark and lacking in contrast.  In post production, you should increase the contrast thereby  added a touch of brightest white. Mostly this image needs a black point.  For me this would be found in the eyes and a few spots in the background behind the feathers.  A true black and brightened midtones would add alot of pop to this image. ",
  "depth_of_field": "The depth and focus is appropriate since this is not a very deep composition.",
  "color_lighting": "There seems to be a bit of a yellow cast, but I kind of like the psuedo - sunburst effect this gives to the bird.  Also this image might be quite stunning as a black and white.  Try adjusting white balance to something cooler - but I am not sure it would be an improvement.  This would be down to artistic taste.  The back lighting behind the tail is very nice in this image.  The striped lighting on the tail is not  ideal in my opinion.  I find it distracts away, especially the shadow that falls in the upper left.  Consider a crop to eliminate this or brightening those specific spots that have a shadow. ",

There are cultural references particularly in the clothing she's wearing, and also her appearance, that indicate this is an Asian/Indian setting. Your subject, the woman putting her hand in a stream of water from a pipe, is prominent in the image and it's clear she and the activity she is engaged in is the primary focal point of the image.",
  "composition": "Your composition is mostly centered, which for a portrait is fine in my opinion. The central composition might be due to distracting elements either to the left or right of the subject, also. There is some indication of that in the brick/stone visible above the pipe on the right side of the image. you're shooting at the right height for your subject to capture her expression and not create a distorted perspective which would make her look taller (if shooting from a lower angle) or shorter (if shooting from a higher angle). Your model is looking down and to the left, which makes me want to ask the question, \"What's down there?\" What is she looking at out of frame? A more effective gaze would be at her hand in the water or at the camera.",
  "use_of_camera": "Your exposure is good and your shutter speed selection give a little motion to the water. My preference for the water would be for more blur. There is a range of shutter speeds, in my opinion, that don't blur water enough, either making it look like a mistake or causing the water to be a distracting rather than complimentary element in the image. The blur you have on the water here is not distracting or appear to be a mistake, but it is on the fringe. More blur would impart greater movement of the water which could add an interesting graphic element to the photograph.",
  "depth_of_field": "Goods use of shallow depth of field to separate your subject from the background",
  "color_lighting": "Related to exposure, the light on your subject is even, either in open shade under a tree or canopy or diffused by cloud, so there is detail in the face and her expression. There is a bit of overexposure in the background (in the upper left and left of her face) that could be darkened down to be less distracting. The green vegetation (the background in general) could be darkened a little. This can be done relatively easily using Photoshop or other program with layers capability by duplicating the image layer and selecting the Multiply blend mode. Use a mask to selectively remove the areas that are too dark and use the opacity setting on your brush to fine tune the degree of the mask strength",

But in this case I think that the lines in the image tend to disperse the attention of the viewer off either side of the image frame.  For instance the lines of the plant with the butterfly move from the bottom of the frame diagonally off to the left of the image, the lateral side of the plant does just the opposite, diagonally bottom to right side.  As a result the viewers attention is split in two directions.  ",
  "use_of_camera": "I think your exposure settings were for the most part very good and worked for this image.  I think the depth of field could have been just a bit more shallow (although I like the effect).  You were using a 1.8 lens so you could have opened up your aperture a bit more and thus softened the background even more.  I say this because there is some detail behind the butterfly wings that tends to detract from the butterfly itself.  A wider aperture would have created a more soft effect and perhaps softened the lines behind the wings. ",

B&W gives a very special strength to it.I'm not sure you're already there but I can see that you going for it and trying and for that you can count on my help to find your image style among what's already there and what just won't work in creating a new photographic language.I'll be here if you need me!Cheers",

But then she has an excess of foundation on her face, so much the you can see the powder on top and even above the eye brows, and this reduces the effect because the shot looks like it was staged. If this is so she is great. In case of this being staged it is not her crying that give it away, it is instead the excess of makeup on her skin. She would look much better with less and the shot would have a more natural spontaneous feel. Anyway, this can be the absolute truth of the moment, the thing is that this makeup on her face is not helping.In the end, my questioning is not about why she is crying but weather this is a true situation of a staged one. I'm inclined for the staged situation but then it could be a spontaneous emotion. Not likely but it could be. I like this!Curious to see what you'll bring next.Cheers",

  "general_impression": "Lovely cat and love the sour mood expressed in the face.   It is a great subject and you are thinking like a photographer by choosing a low angle .  Turn your attention to composition and look all around the frame for distractions and eliminate as many as possible .  Blur and depth of field can help in this regard as well.  Keep practicing with your  model and you will capture some really good stuff while improving your skills",
  "subject_of_photo": "Cats are great subjects because they express very physically to the point where there is no question what they feel and sometimes it is exactly how we feel.  This cat is very pretty and great at emoting.  People always love animal photos and it is a great training ground for doing wildlife.  The way the cushion squishes down under her front paws is a great feature and tells the story of a nice place to sleep - but I got woken up!!",
  "composition": "There are some problems here that put together drag this photo down from \"photograph\" to \"snapshot\" . The crooked horizon line is the first thing - which can be fixed .  What is right is using the low angle - it is great for small subjects and puts the viewer into the cat's world and equal to them - a fresh perspective.  Being aware of objects in the background often sets a photo apart from a snapshot. If you had turned off the light in the background and moved the pillows/bedding on the left out of frame, this would elevate the entire image.  I think the background would have been an almost solid dark hiding all the features back there.  Just the cat, her soft cushy mattress, and  emotion would remain which is all this needs to make an impact.  At little bit more tail - if it had swished to the left a bit and a little more eyes would have been great. ",
  "use_of_camera": "The speed and exposure look pretty good.  I might like a touch brighter just in the darks in her face.  I like the darkness  in the background since there is nothing to be seen there and the distracting elements need hiding. ",
  "depth_of_field": "The depth of field gives a slight feeling of length to the cat and makes the head on orientation more interesting.  ",
  "color_lighting": "The built in flash did pretty well to light the blacks on the face where the shadows needed opening and did not over expose the white chest.  The problem is that the straight on lighting is a bit flat and predictable.  A side source of light coming from the left to light the body would be nice.  How are your Photoshop skills?  you could brighten this left side using a mask to just effect the body on the left side. ",
  "focus": "The focus looks very sharp right where it needs to be:  the face and especially the eyes.  The rest of the body and scene are less important so it is good that it falls away from being in sharp focus. ",

I'm not sure if it was cropped this tight in the camera or if you have more image area available to you, but if you do, you might want to try a recrop of the file.",

The work you did in post processing, black & white with a touch of red just in the right places was a great addition.. The two red lines were a nice feel, just adding the red to the tire would not of been enough.",
  "composition": "Composition is good, I can see you followed the basic 2/3rds rule of composition. You choose the upper right 2/3rds and I would of probably gone for the bottom right 2/3rds position for the tire / wheel. The clean space below your wheel is clean but I would of liked to see less of it and more of what is above. I also find the arm / hand and the person in the background a little distracting, the white highlights on the sweater are to hot and distract the viewers eye away from the simplicity of the rest of the photo.",
  "use_of_camera": "It looks like you were shooting indoors. The shutter speed could be slower for this still object, this would allow the aperture too be smaller, f/ 8 or f/11 allowing you a larger range of focus on the subject.

The horizon line and your stabilizing objects rest primarily in the center of the frame here.  That and its mostly horizontal element placement suggests stolidity and calm.  There is some slight movement of the flow into the frame created by the sharp bend of the water as it curves left around the jut of land with the trees on it.  It doesn't dramatically take your attention into the center, but rather gently suggests that the action is moving that way. There are also some very subtle and effective 'non linear' compositional elements that make this image work.  The subtle mist which is rising from the water and merging with the fog and mist in the air creates depth and mystery here and the contrast of the dark and light works to create depth as well.",
  "use_of_camera": "I think your settings were for the most part good enough to capture a nice image.  I think perhaps the very broad tonal and brightness range of your image environment might have called for an exposure mode other than multi-segment, or matrix which you used.  I will discuss this more in the color and lighting section.  I see you were not using a tripod which could have given you more latitude on your camera settings choices.  Also I believe your exposure mode of program AE, while a good one to use for many conventionally lit or less contrasty environments might have been different as well.  ",

There are some great and subtle glowing mist areas coming off the water that if brought out will really enhance the mystical nature of this shot.  I think that while the lighting is indeed dramatic and eye catching, the sky where the sun is as well as its reflection in the water, is a very bright area that takes up a considerable area of sky and foreground.  This is not an issue for the most part, but it is a bit bright and could be dealt with in post processing, or at capture using some different approaches to exposure.  ",

Aperture priority is the norm for vast landscape shots and with a greater-depth-of-field we would have seen more detail in that beautifully sunlit patch in the distance.

  "general_impression": "John, you have an excellent camera and the 100mm macro on the Canon is also a stellar performer.  I like this image, and all the distinctly compelling visual elements within it.  I also like the soft backdrop that is formed by the sand and its organic looking ripples. There is nothing particularly wrong about this image, but I think its composition could be improved some. What follows are some ideas for a few things you could do to make the image more commanding in its presence.  ",
  "subject_of_photo": "Desert subjects are always interesting because their forms are usually unusual, twisted, and strongly featured, and because the lighting of the environment is often strong as well.  I like this image just because the forms in it take on a human aspect and are quixotically humorous. It almost appears as if the central, and larger wood form, has thrown its arms up in exasperation or surrender.  I can see why it might make one smile.   ",
  "composition": "There are a number of very compelling and graphically pleasing elements in this image.  The sand striations caused by the wind, the sharply delineated shadows which mimic the shapes of the wood, as well as the depressions around each of the wood bodies and the different texture of sand caused by the sand being blown around the stalks.  The small, delicate grass strands also add to the textural feast there.  Having said this I'll say too that I think that these elements do not come together as well in a cohesive manner as they could.  I think the lines of the sand moving in sensual snaking rhythms slightly diagonally from bottom right to upper left, do bring the eye into the composition.  But the horizontal placement, and unevenly sized grouping the three wood shapes tend to fight that movement into the frame and serve as a visual barrier to some degree for me. I think that a lack of any strong leading lines from the margins of the image into the composition weakens it, despite all of its interesting elements and forms.   ",
  "use_of_camera": "The exposure settings look fine I think. Its a real benefit when you have the conditions under which you can shoot at 100 ISO.  Good sweet spot f/11 and a fast shutter speed since you weren't using a tripod.    ",
  "depth_of_field": "",
  "color_lighting": "I didn't hear back regarding the color situation in your environment.  The reason I asked was because to me the image has a slight red/orange cast to it. While its not unattractive, and you may have been going for a warmer look, I think it is also picked up in the wood hue as well.  I like the slanting sunlight as it picks up a lot of the detail and texture of the sand and ripples.  However the front sides of the wood stalks lose some detail just because they are in shadow with the sun pretty much to their backside.  Perhaps some of the artifacts and noise I see there in them were from post processing and bringing out that shadow area.  ",

She is mysterious and alluring which serves to say that either you have a special connection or you did manage to create it for the shot. Well done!For me the background is too dark, it's pitch black. I like to see some texture there even if it's hard to see, but that way I can understand better the surrounding and what was happening during the shoot. It's also nice to have some texture even if it's just a bit. We should always have texture.Anyway, you've done a good work!Curious to see more of what you do!Cheers",

  "general_impression": "Mary. I'm probably a little prejudiced since road images are my favorite sorts of shots to take. Road images, while containing no human figures usually, are nonetheless evidence of our insinuation into nature.  I think I like them too because they are a reminder of how much open space there is left to us here, and an open invitation to go explore it.  There are a few things that I think you can do to improve the image some.  These are not criticisms as much as they are suggestions that, if you make, may make the image just a bit more compelling and dramatic.  ",
  "subject_of_photo": "Mary, I love road images. In my travels across the country, particularly in the desert where the skies are low to the ground, and you can actually stop your car on the road without fear of another one coming by for a while to get out in the middle and shoot, you have an opportunity to capture a classic perspective and composition that is both pleasing to the eye, and metaphorically resonant with all of us.  ",
  "composition": "I think that normally you'd stay away from a center composition where the road divides the frame in half. In this case the point of view is low enough to provide a sense of distance, balance, motion and dynamism.  Sometimes the symmetry demands a center composition.  The straightness of the road doesn't lend itself, I think, to a diagonal composition because a lot of the images charm is that the road leads you very deep and far into the distant horizon.  The only drawback to your composition has nothing to do with your preparation or position, but rather with the unfortunate fact that the shrubbery grows only on the right side of the road and sort of throws the nice, vanishing point lines, out of balance.  ",
  "use_of_camera": "Pretty safe exposures considering the amount of light available.  I see that you were at 640th of a second at 40mm.  I would like to see the ISO at 100 for this image because you have the latitude to do it.  100ISO would have required a slower shutter speed but remember that you can pretty safely shoot an image, hand held, by roughly matching or slightly exceeding the F stop number, in this case 40, with the denominator portion of the shutter speed (ie, 1/640 would be 640).  Here you were at a comparative value of 40 to 640, a lot of room to play with for proper focus and exposure. So you could safely have shot at 1/60th of a second '60' being the denominator matching your f stop of 40.  100 ISO is just a cleaner, more noise free setting for shots that are well and evenly lit, as this one was. ",
  "depth_of_field": "Good deep and appropriate for this image.",
  "color_lighting": "The colors of this image are varied and subtly beautiful hues.  There are a number of soft and gentle rifts defined in the far hills by the muted shadows and soft lines of the intersecting planes of hill lines too.  I like the gritty juxtaposition of the asphalt texture that bifurcates and cuts like a knife through the otherwise soft composition.  Although the shot was at noon, it is not harsh and the lack of shadows does not hurt this composition but instead provides a very clean uncluttered look to it. ",
  "focus": "very sharp throughout the plane.  ",

  "subject_of_photo": "Thanh, Great portrait of this fitness  trainer ,of course the angle and pose are well versed by him, your selection of location by the window light  brings out the muscular  upper body. The supporting equipment  I like , naturally because  it  is directly related and supports  the main subject.",
  "composition": "over all thanh, your composition is very good  rule of thirds subject in 2 and 4 position, well balanced and cropped at the waist. the corner  room  selection  helps give  depth and the equipment  helps to support what your subject is all about. Natural window light when used properly helps give  the most important features  shape to the subject with natural tones.  One thought is  perhaps to have shot this or crop out the window, but in this case it adds as a visual source of light direction. the contrast is a little soft and could use more  the gain to loss from one side of the body to  his face would be only slight.",
  "use_of_camera": "This was a auto setting shot, and overall is very good , however by using a tripod and manual setting you can improve the density on the left side  to tone down the right arm and part of the center body, in manual  the use of the light meter and bracketing your work would help to secure  the optimum tonal balance the ISo  used is ok  but the shutter and f stop could be adjusted to achieve a more rich skin tone and darken the left side. ",

  "color_lighting": "Color is ok  however Thanh, by the above information the density could be adjusted to improve the skin tones and enrich the rest of the image at the same time. hence the color will improve a little as well, this will give you more impact overall.  this portrait thanh is one of a very few I have seen, where  not only using  the window  light as the main source but  there is a secondary light source   a kicker on the right side giving three dimensional  shape to his face right side and arm right side just fantastic to see this !!!!!",
  "focus": "focus is good, but could have  a little improvement  more with camera settings to help  the  use of  the f stop. ",

  "general_impression": "Hi there Art and thank you for asking me to provide feedback on your photograph. There are several aspects to this shot that have been done very well, The shutter speed to capture the water and the depth of field to provide clarity of detail throughout the shot are great. There's plenty of light in your shot too but there are a couple of areas where you could try something different. Your composition has little interest outside the centre of the shot and I have made a few suggestions below. I hope you find my feedback interesting but if you want to ask other questions feel free to contact me on the messaging service.Kind regards,Ken McKillop",
  "subject_of_photo": "The focus of interest in your shot is right in the centre with the water flowing over the rocks which has been done nicely, the long exposure slowing the water just enough but then there is a lot of space which doesn't add any interest to this frame.",
  "composition": "Composition is centre focussed with nothing outside the centre circle to offer any other interest to your photo.",
  "use_of_camera": "Exposure is good with plenty of light in your shot with the shutter speed capturing the water very well. ISO at 100 is also good and there's no graininess showing which would be associated with higher ISO's",
  "depth_of_field": "Depth of field is appropriate for this shot with plenty of detail from front to back and especially in the water.",
  "color_lighting": "Light in your shot is good as a result of appropriate exposure, speed and depth of field however colours are almost monotone with browns and greys being predominant.",
  "focus": "Focus on the stones in the centre of the shot is good with plenty of detail throughout with the milkiness of the water showing nicely.",

  "subject_of_photo": "Airplanes are a pretty popular subject to look at for a lot of people, and \"older\" ones like this spitfire evoke a sense of nostalgia as well. Because we don't see them \"in action\" these days, a good picture is sure to catch the viewers attention. All in all : a great choice, subject-wise !",
  "composition": "A tight crop to show of every possible detail is a good choice, and because the plane is banking you get a better view than you would normally have from the ground. Personally, I would have cropped the plane just a bit closer, leaving enough \"space\" around the airplane \"to fly in\", so to speak. A plane traveling from right to left in frame creates a different \"feel\" than a plane moving from left to right, but as a photographer on the ground you have to work with the route the plane is flying. A good effort overall !",
  "use_of_camera": "",
  "depth_of_field": "",
  "color_lighting": "The image is a bit too dark and lacks a bit of contrast to my liking. There's a pretty narrow divider between \"too modified\" and \"natural\" with images like this one, but especially the low contrast gives the image a bit of a \"flat\" feel; the plane could stand out a bit more by adding some contrast to the entire image. Maybe this rendition is closer to the actual situation when you took this shot, but your average viewer won't know that.",
  "focus": "The airplane is in focus, but still there's a sense of movement. I think I prefer it like this instead of \"pin sharp\" overall; this approach shows it is actually a full scale plane in flight, not a detailed model on a stand. Using the AI Servo helps to take a couple of shots in quick succession; keeping a moving subject at this distance sharp without it would be pretty challenging.",

I also wonder why you went with a black and white treatment of this photo?  In my opinion, it doesn't help the photo at all and probably hurts it a bit.  Even though these are white flowers, there is still lots of color within the flower itself which could help make this a more dramatic image.Please read my ideas for improving this photo and then try again.I'm confident that you'll be able to produce a more dramatic, better composed picture and I look forward to seeing it.Thanks,Paul",

  "general_impression": "Hello Justin, I do understand the effect you were going for by using this special lens attachment. But to me it does not work very well. Your idea was a good one but I do not feel it follows through to the viewer. To me it looks like a photo taken from a moving car with a low quality camera / lens. A different camera angle is needed, there is too much sky and you needed to get closer to your subject. Vignette works for some photographs but here it tells me wide angle lens of poor quality. Your idea and eye was a good one, do not give up on this type of photography or this special lens, try different ideas and subjects and you will find a good use for this lens attachment. Special effects in photography is always a good thing.",
  "subject_of_photo": "A sunny day at the beach, bride & groom, ice cream truck are all good subjects. But when they are all put together I think it is just too much. The roadway in the foreground and too much sky do not help focus on your subject either.",
  "composition": "The bottom half of this shot is where the subjects are. More then half of this photograph is sky. A different camera angle is needed for better composition and perspective. \"If you think you are close, get closer\", this would help this photograph a lot when it comes to composition.",

I do notice you used ISO 800 which under usual conditions on a sunny day is too high, a good starting point for ISO would be between ISO 100 & 200. Did this lens have a set aperture opening, is it selected for you?",

  "general_impression": "This is a really lovely shot and I can understand why you made it. I also like your title which conveys the idea of dawn and cosmic light. I think you have a good eye for what can make a shot emotionally expressive - well done! ",
  "subject_of_photo": "Hi Cynthia, great concept behind this shot and it has worked well, there is a sense of light being emitted rather than reflected from the flower. It reminds me of pictures by the famous painter Paul Klee who said that there are two types of light: light on and light through. The latter is what he meant by a kind of spiritual light which seems to shine from within an object. This is what you have captured so beautifully in your shot. There are no details provided regarding shutter speed, ISO etc so I am presuming this photo was taken using fully automatic settings, and my critique will be based on that. ",
  "composition": "The composition is simple and direct and you have moved in close eliminating any distracting background details would have taken the eye away from the central idea. I like the perspective as the flower shape is straight in front of the viewer but also has the sensation of looking up at the top of a dome in a church and seeing light pouring through. Contrast is good, and the balance of dark and light areas works well in this respect.",
  "use_of_camera": "Exposure and white balance are both fine. No info available on shutter speed but when shooting macro or close-up shots of flowers you need good light so that you can get fast shutter speeds to freeze the motion of the flower head. Even the slightest breeze can make the petals slightly blurred. ",
  "depth_of_field": "Depth-of-field is shallow - good for close-ups - but may be just too shallow as nothing is in focus, as I said beforem and overall the shot is very fuzzy.",
  "color_lighting": "I love the color of this shot, blue and indigo are very spiritual colors and these particular colors are excellent for expressing your concept. Lighting is good, no hard shadows just soft natural light which works best with flower photos.",
  "focus": "There is no point in the photograph which is sharply focussed. I like the softness of this shot but it would have been enhanced by at least one point being in focus. I think you may have been just a little too close to the flower for the camera to focus automatically. If you can't use manual focussing (which I believe the L100 does not support), then I suggest you check with the camera manual and find the minimum focus that your lens is capable of. You may also be using the Macro Mode on your camera but again, you need to know the minimum focussing distance. If one small part of your shot is kept in focus then it creates greater interest and stops the eye from wandering out of the frame.",
  "description": "I was stunned by how the light seemed to come out of the flower rather than the light shinning ON the flower. What am I trying to convey?  That same light shined out from            ",

Second and  created by nature and captured by you is the foreground  middle ground and background, these steps and the  depth  create a excellent flow  toward the viewer !!! and give your Photograph great depth .

  "use_of_camera": " The  ISO 100, and f 29, and a  2 sec exposure  in use with a ND filter and a polarizer work  well together and produce a image with  great density  and detail along with the lighting conditions to produce the water flow  like  sugar. Some images I  have viewed the photographer will often  drag the shutter to much creating a white out of the water, leaving no details which is a fault that drops the impact. However not in your Photograph  just right in my Professional view !! ",

THE offset of the rock color in some areas of orange  along with the foreground rocks help dramatically with  color shift and  act like a vinetted image  drawing your eye from them  and back to the falls. Excellently produced and  shot !!! ",

  "general_impression": "Bob, I think you show great technical expertise in how you have executed this shot. There are some minor issues that you can work on that I have indicated in the respective field. For you to improve as a photographer you might need to take a step back and look at the story you are trying to tell. I have only seen one of your shots, but you can go back to the best shots you made last year and try to find a theme, or different themes. Are you trying to tell a story, or are you just executing great technical shots? Look at work of other great landscape photographers and see what emotions are invoked when you look at their photos. And why do their pictures evoke those emotions so strongly?If you had included a description with a more deliberate story of why you sent me this shot I would have rated it even higher. As it stands I think it is a good shot from a photographer that shows a lot of potential.",
  "subject_of_photo": "Bob, this is a great subject. I love to go into the forest in the morning and take shots. The reason I am not giving you full marks on this is that you have not included a description. What is the story you are trying to tell with this shot? What makes this shot better than just standing there (where I can feel the morning chill being slowly pushed away by the sun as it breaches through the branches). Right now it is a very good postcard shot.",
  "composition": "I really like that you have taken care to choose a different cropping ratio. I assume you have just removed the top and the bottom of your 18mm shot and not taken a panorama?Some thing that I do not find to my liking is the little distractions that you have left on the edges. For example the little tuft of grass at the middle bottom of the screen keeps drawing my eye, I would have cropped that away a little more so that this distraction is not there. On the left there is also a single branch sticking into the frame and it is a little distracting. I like how you have put the sun in almost the corner but you gave it enough space to still be a good 'part' of the shot.",
  "use_of_camera": "It is great that you have used the small aperture opening and slow shutter speed in combination with a tripod. Do however take care that at F22 you get this beautiful star effect from the sun rays but you sharpness might actually decrease. Experiment with your camera to find out if you are approaching the diffraction limit of your lens/camera combination and what is a safe F-stop to go down to.",
  "depth_of_field": "Good choice of depth of field. In a landscape shot like this everything should be tack sharp. Except of course the water, which is nicely blurred using the motion blur due to the long exposure.",
  "color_lighting": "I really like the lighting. It is masterfully done the way you have waited for the sun to come through the trees like that. I must say however, that I find the scene a little bit on the blue side. It gives me a feeling of cold. Did you shoot in RAW mode? If so can you go back to your shot and play with the White Balance settings? Perhaps if you make the shot a little bit 'warmer' you get a more appealing colour pallet. (It is nice to see you have your focus and aperture settings on manual, but now also focus on the WB and choose it carefully).",
  "focus": "The focus is great. From what I can see on this resolution it is very sharp indeed. If you didn't make a panorama though, you have thrown away valuable pixels by cropping the top and bottom to get this aspect ratio. Pixels that you could have used to print this shot at a larger size, I always get the feeling these kind of shots should be printed quite large to get the full immersion effect of looking at them.",

  "composition": "Nick compositionally , well done, you  have used  three good methods to create this image. Thirds by where the eye ends up to the symmetrical castle, and second the use of reflection, third by increasing the density in the sky. The balance of the trees in threes adds to a flowing pattern as well. The bridge is a great diagonal line that leads in from the right and to the castle , all these are well used and put together. However Nick, the density in the sky lacks the detail in the  clouds and lacks contrast and brightness. I think if you had been able to either move back  to gain more foreground or as you mentioned a wider angle lens, this would have improved   the image and allowed it to breath a little more. The light on the right  is cut off in the reflection and the trees at the bottom in the reflection as well are cut,  to tight.",
  "use_of_camera": "The speed, and shutter speeds are  correct for this shot and the use of 1/35 sec  shows good exposure and density  needed for  all tones in the gray scale. But I agree with you a wider angle lens would of helped in a few area's as mentioned above.",

  "general_impression": "Oliver, thank you for sharing your image with me.  As I mentioned above it is a very striking image and I'm sure will evoke its share of interest in anyone who views it.  Sunsets however always, just because of the nature of their bright and glorious colors, tend to do that even in bad compositions.  Your composition is a good one but as I said earlier tends to move the eye a bit off the frame of the image.  Below are a few suggestions that may be of assistance to you in maximizing the image or in future images.  ",
  "subject_of_photo": "Oliver, This is a striking image primarily because of the colors and patterns in the sky.  Sunsets combined with still water create a sense of depth and symmetry that a sunset over land often times lacks, simply because of the reflection aspect.  I think the subject of this image, which is to me simply the colors and patterns of the clouds, is a compelling one that will always draw interest from the viewer.",
  "composition": "I think that the composition and perspective here are pretty good.  You have three sets of what I would consider leading lines; the clouds angling in from upper left and diagonally downwards, the horizon which is for the most part horizontal, and the small spit of land on the lower right hand side of the image that angles diagonally from the center frame margin to approximately a third of the way up the right margin.  The effect of these lines is to move the eye to the right and pretty much off the frame.  This isn't a 'wrong' composition but to my eye it tends to feel a little unbalanced.  However the almost Zig-zag pattern formed by the three lines IS interesting and does have the effect of somewhat drawing the eye back into the image.  There is strength in diagonal compositions and a dynamic tension is created as a result.  ",
  "use_of_camera": "I think the exposure settings were fine.  If you were not trying to capture the shadow detail in the land forms then the combination of small aperture, low ISO and relatively fast shutter speed enabled you to capture the cloud detail and leave the land forms in silhouette.  I think that the center of the brightest part of the sky is a maybe a little bit overblown but this is not a big issue considering you can fix it in post processing. This is a tough exposure since the tonal range of light runs the gamut and makes it difficult to take an image that doesn't give up one side of the histogram to expose correctly for the other.  ",
  "depth_of_field": "",
  "color_lighting": "The colors on this image are its strong suit.  The juxtaposition of dark blue sky, with the orange and red clouds are nicely set apart by the subtle gauzy whitish clouds a the upper center of the image.  The color is nicely carried to the lower part of the image in the relatively smooth surface of the water.  ",
  "focus": "Looks fine to me. I'd have to see the full resolution photograph to be sure. But on the site it looks fine. ",

  "general_impression": "This image is good.  Based on crop and composition it looks like you know what you want in an end result.  The main thing holding you back is the fact that you don't have enough lens to reach your subject without losing to much clarity after cropping.  Try you best to shoot as tight as you can on your subjects and crop to fix little alignment problems in composition and/or slight tightness issues.",
  "subject_of_photo": "The subject is prominent in the photo.  A slightly tighter cropping or a tighter shot would bring out the 37 bike more.  There is enough action in the background even tighter you would still know he is being hounded.",
  "composition": "Similar to subject I think tighter would give the viewer a little more intimacy with the image.",
  "use_of_camera": "The shutter speed and exposure seem ok for this type of shot.  When the bikes are straight on panning and a slower shutter speed isn't always required.  However,  if you can pan a little bit on the lead bike the following bikes will get a bit more blur because they'll be moving in a different direction as you pan.  This will bring the 37 bike out from the others even more.  You can start by trying a shutter speed of 1/(bike speed).  So if they are going 60 here try 1/60th and if that is to blurry try 1/125th and so on until you get a little bit of motion blur but still have the front bike sharp while you pan on that subject.",
  "depth_of_field": "The depth of field is good for this image.  Like noted before a little bit of motion blur and maybe a little bit of a tighter shot or crop can help removing background objects just like a narrower depth of field.",
  "color_lighting": "When shooting in daylight for sports it sometimes becomes a battle with the sun.  In order to bring out the darker part of the rider on the underside of the bike you can overexpose your image by 2/3 of a stop and then adding some contrast in post processing.  The contrast will help keep the bright spots from losing color and the overexposure will help give a little bit more light to the darker areas.  This is something that takes some practice.",
  "focus": "The focus seems fine, but the image does appear to be a heavy crop.  Sometimes this is unavoidable and racing events.  It is difficult to find areas that are easy to photograph without credentials.  The location where the shot was taken is nice.  A longer lens would have allowed for less cropping and more clarity in the end result.",

  "general_impression": "Christine, a nice composition. Many good compositions are made after looking over a subject for some time, either over a few minutes, several days or longer. Much of the success of a photo is also determined by timing. This image would look very different with a clear sky, if the tide was higher, or the sun was lower in the sky, etc. You've selected a time of day when the shadow areas were visible, the sky had some interesting elements, and the overall lighting conditions were more easily captured by the camera's sensor without fighting the high contrast so often encountered at the beach. Continue looking for those interesting scenes and elements on the beach that many others pass by without a second glance. ",
  "subject_of_photo": "It's very easy to get a \"typical\" beach shot of sand and surf. Beaches/coastlines are similar to deserts. The landscape is very similar just about everywhere you look and it takes some real looking to find the subjects that are \"atypical\" and more interesting. You've done that here. ",
  "composition": "Your choice of a lower point of view emphasizes the vertical orientation of the roots and the right-hand placement balances the water and clouds nicely, with just enough of a base of sand. All together, it gives the viewer a very nice scene to look at and explore and a sense of being there. The debris in the high tide line leading into the image at the bottom then out the right side behind the roots is a good visual anchor and leading line mirroring the shape of the surf.Your horizon line is slightly tilted, higher on the left. It's not much, but horizon lines, especially waterlines, need to be straight and any deviation needs to be understood by the viewer as intentional or it's interpreted as a mistake. I think you may have been trying to make sure the roots were vertical and in the process skewed the horizon a bit. If the roots leaned a little to the left it would be ok.",
  "use_of_camera": "I like that the shadows in the roots show detail, but on my monitor the clouds in the upper left appear to be overexposed and detail and texture is lost. This creates an area of brightness and high contrast that attracts the eye away from the rest of the image.",
  "depth_of_field": "Depth of field is good and all elements that need to be in focus are.",
  "color_lighting": "The colors are great, with the yellow of the sand, turquoise water, and blue clouds. The light is diffused a bit by the cloud cover which reduces contrast to a manageable level.",

Below are some suggestions for improving your creation. I think that your approach was a good idea and I think it could be strengthened by some cropping, lighting adjustments in your threshold treatment, and some minor cloning.",
  "subject_of_photo": "Its hard for me to adjudge the rating to the 'subject' of the image here as the subject is existing Art, in this case a sculpture.  I think that this is not an extremely interesting subject, so its presentation and treatment becomes thus, more important.  I'd give this a 'good' as far as interest level goes.  It fills the frame nicely.  ",
  "composition": "I think the composition is pretty good.  Its pretty flat and horizontal.  There isn't much in the way of dynamic movement or lines.  Any leading lines inside the composition are lost in the contrasted nature of the 'threshold' treatment. There is a lot of white area, but it seems fairly well balanced with the dark subject area.  I don't usually like center placed compositions but in this case, in showing off the fountain, it works fine.  The foliage in the lower right is rather distracting. I think the image might be more powerful and graphic without the lower part of the fountain.  There is so very little detail there that it is difficult to see what the objects are with any clarity. Resultingly they seem a bit blobbish.  A crop might be in order here.",
  "use_of_camera": "",

  "color_lighting": "I like the almost Litho, etching look of this image.  It has a very 19th century appeal to it.  It looks a lot like some of the classical works that used to be popular during the turn of the century. I think the image could benefit from some mid-tone lightening so that some of the facial detail and upper wing detail of the angel could be discerned. Right now they are simply just dark shapes, while some of the image (with the exception of the pedestal portion) has line detail.  Strangely enough I like the total blackout of the underside of the fountain bowl.  ",

  "composition": "Whilst it is difficult to be critical of this image assuming that tyhe subject was stationary and possibly access to the shot was limited. A slightly different viewpoint (moving along the river side to the left) would have closed the shot up a little. Its a pity that there was not more space to the left of the signs and that the gap between the right of the sign and the bridge had been filled. The bridge is leaning a little too obviously due to the distotion of the lens which might have been corrected using a perspective filter in post production software.",
  "use_of_camera": "Exposure seems to be about bang on. Its nice that the olympic rings look like they are on fire due to the severe overexposure. But the lighting on the bridge is great and the reflection on the water is excellent. A wise use of the tripod using a slow shutter speed to blur the water a little. Overall a technically well executed image.",

  "general_impression": "Hey Francois. Very good image. I enjoyed it very much as a subject matter; discretely stollen, spontaneous moments. And I enjoyed the technically proficient execution and post processing, which of course makes the former possible. I would have liked to see a little more from your subjects (see below) but apart from that a very good shot. Well done.",
  "subject_of_photo": "One of my favourite subject matters, especially when done covertly in order to capture the spontaneity of the subject matter.",
  "composition": "I like the from-the-hip view. It works very well for the atmosphere of this subject. The composition is good overall however I will nitpick some details. The image should be slightly tilted to the left to be straight. Also, I'm guessing that since you were shooting from the hip and you were and the widest angle your lens had to offer you chose to include a little air in front of the gentleman on the left but had to sacrifice the lady on the right's back. Ideally a little air after her too would work well to centre the image and not cut it abruptly without reason. It would also draw and lead the viewer better if you had tilted your camera up a bit when shooting. The floor in the bottom part of the image is unnecessary and doesnt weigh well with the frame that that the shelf on the top creates. It is an abrupt cut-off which although not crucial may have served to balance the image better. More importantly it would have brought your main subject (the laughing lady) into the centre of the frame. The eye falls on her either way but if she was a little more centered it would make for a more comfortable viewing experience. Finally, it would also complete the gradual diagonal lighting fade from left to right which would also make for a more comfortable viewing experience. ",
  "use_of_camera": "Excellent camera use and speed. Perhaps a little more underexposed to avoid those burnt bits would wotk better. I enjoy high contrast, and in some instances burn too, but for this image although the high contrast works well, the burn is too much. Also, the shadow/highlights in post athough adding to the overall atmosphere would work better applied a little more discretely, especially since you have burn.",
  "depth_of_field": "Very good. Since you had plenty of light perhaps closing that aperture to 4 or even 5.6 would make for a crisper image concerning the gentleman on the left but apart from that very good.",
  "color_lighting": "B&W works extremely well with the atmosphere of this image and is a very good choice. Lighting is awesome, with plentiful natural light coming in from the left and fading to the right.",

THe second good element is the red tree in rule of thirds  postion 1 and 3 and is very strong and leads your eye to this  tree then to where the water flow begins.Third is the reflection  itself. Rowais  if you use photoshop or another program , look closely at the waterline, it is slightly higher on the  left and lower on the right , when cropping you can correct this balance. Just a thought Rowais on the angle you shot this , if possible it would have been better to move  to the left more and gain more of the tree line. That would ofcourse depend on if it is possible.",

Love the way you caught this shape, the water is very malleable and in this case it's taking the shape of a bird, which is quite interesting since it's really flying. It could be a chicken, with two legs on the bottom left, the head on the bottom right and the tail on top. A chicken in a nosedive!This is something you can explore more and I think you'll be able to do it much better if you keep at it, so my advice is do go one and continue freezing water!

  "composition": "You've filled the frame up nicely and in a balanced way.  The lack of detail in the sky does not detract from the composition as you have chosen a point of view that includes less sky and more foreground.  The leading lines, while not powerful, are nonetheless effective.  The road leads subtly back into the composition and takes the viewers attention INTO the iamge.  The foreground detail, ie the deadfall wood provides some framing, and an anchor, and along with the figures in the image provides a sense of scale and dimension.  ",

  "color_lighting": "The overall lighting is even and satisfactory throughout the tonal range. There is some haloing around the tops of the mountains where the ridgeline meets the sky.  This is most likely due to post processing to bring down the brightness of the sky but I can't be sure.  I think the colors are very good and as I said earlier the lighting even. But I also think it could be a bit brighter, particularly if you are going to print this image.  ",
  "focus": "I'm not too sure due to the low resolution of the images that appear on the site, but it appears that your point of focus was the foreground deadwood, as it appears to be in sharp resolution while the mid to background appears soft to me.

There is some potential with this church but it won't be easy to make it happen and achieve a great result.Regarding the changes you made, I don't use Canon and don't know your camera very well, so I don't know exactly what your talking about that you move from 0.1 to 6.7 unless you get more specific and tell me exactly what your telling me about, with units, so I can understand what kind of regulation is that you altered on your camera. The units for focus are usually in meters or feet and they are not something that you set in camera but on the focus ring. Please give me more detailed information about that so I can help you properly.This result if unsharp and very blurry in the edges, so let's try and see what might've happened, both on my comments and suggestions.Cheers",

  "use_of_camera": "Using your camera manually will always be good, but be careful to go all manual. Using auto-bracketing will not be helpful. This is not a very good solution.",
  "depth_of_field": "This is a situation where I believe that your rig won't be to get a very good result without getting in one side diffraction issues if you close your f-stops to mush and if you don't close they you won't get enough DoF. This is a reason why not to go for high resolution cameras and it's one of the resons why the flagship camera from Nikon is never very high. The D4 is 16MP but the D3S is 12MP, they both are fullframe so they can handle more resolution without hitting the diffraction issues limit, but in that regard the D3S will fair better because it has a lower res. The more res a camera has the less it can close the f-stops, and if it has something like your camera: 18MP on a small APS-C sensor, then the limit will be much lower. You just can't shoot that big DoF without having diffraction issues, and not putting your f-stop small enough there is no way you can have this much distance all in focus. This book is not covered by your DoF here and like this I'm not sure this composition makes sense. The alternative would be to assume a low DoF solution, going for the book or the stained glass. Or maybe you focused the stained glass and not the middle of your focusing distance on the ring, and so you're not taking advantage of your DoF.",
  "color_lighting": "This is not particularly interesting.",
  "focus": "I'm guessing that you focused the stained glass. That is not good. If you want to have the whole thing in focuse with the big DoF you can get, and this is pretty much it, you have to set your focus to the middle of your  relative distance and then the DoF will go both ways.Depth of Field is the the depth of the field that you have in focus both before and beyond the focusing point, so you've got to use this notion to take advantage of your DoF.",

The visible stars with the brightly lit moonlight landscape works nicely here.  Some of the things I mentioned in my critique regarding the nature of the light and its apparent unnatural appearance, may in fact be a natural outcome, however sometimes its good to make the lighting do in post processing what our eyes expect light from a particular direction to do naturally.  I will speak to this below.  ",

I think that there is a little over saturation in the major mountain peak.  The desert plants have some very nice fringe lighting that you have brought out with dodging and apparently highlight/shadow adjustment.  Its often hard to tell, on a timed exposure, if the lighting is natural or not.  Here it appears that the moonlight is illuminating parts of the landscape that would not, naturally, be illuminated thusly by a  moon that is just at the crest of a distant hill.  For example the lighting on the mountain face, while pleasing to the eye, seems a bit brighter that it would be considering the moon is behind the mountain and not high enough to frontally light it.  The same is true for some of the foliage in the foreground, particularly the bush in the lower right, where the lighting extends  down into the lower front of the plant suggesting a light source from in front.  I suspect, and I could very well be wrong, that these lightened areas were the result of some localized dodging. I do like that the moon has been rendered into a bright sun like object which adds to the mystique. ",

Macro photography is very challenging, you selected a subject that is totally different and has a great design and color. You did great to capture the texture of the fuzzy buds.

  "subject_of_photo": "Beautiful filigree and patterns, combined with subtle colours - I understand the attraction in making this shot but it is a very demanding one as the light coming from overhead makes exposing the shot correctly a bit difficult. I've only given this 7/10 as I think the subject is interesting but not very clear.",
  "composition": "Composition is a bit cluttered and because the filigree is such an important part of the picture I would have liked to have seen less of the beams overhead and maybe even less of the balcony at the sides. I like the angle it was shot at with the vertical lines converging quite strongly.",
  "use_of_camera": "ISO of 50 is very good for a shot like this as it brings out all the detail without any digital noise. Exposure is unbalanced - too dark at the bottom with a consequent loss of detail. A shutter speed of 1/253 is quite fast for a static subject and had the camera used a slower speed you could have had a much smaller aperture which is more appropriate for a shot with this amount of depth.",

  "subject_of_photo": "I think you have captured the city scape pretty well.  I don't think it presents as dramatically as it possibly could.  I think the subject, which is not clear in this case, is not particularly clear and is sort of subsumed or diminished in its presence by its placement in the scene.  ",
  "composition": "I think this images main issue is the composition.  It is primarily a flat composition composed of shapes and forms that do not create a sense of volume or depth.  Rather the buildings are stacked with little or no feel for any scale or depth.  The cruise boat itself sort of blends into the scene and is lost for all intent and purpose in the background detail.  I think the city skyline is placed a bit too far back in the composition, is very centrally oriented, and shows a lot of empty blue sky which while good for showing off the silhouette of the skyline, is essentially featureless and a bit bland. Lastly I think the perspective is a bit skewed which feels a bit uncomfortable to me.  The city skyline drops slightly from the left frame to the right side and everything feels a little tilted.  Also some of the buildings might benefit from some perspective adjustment to bring them vertical.  ",

This draws the eye there where it has a tencendy to stay. I see that the timestamp on the camera data says the image was taken at 3:04 in the afternoon.  Perhaps this explains the lack of shadow and contrast in the image and the slight blown out highlights throughout.    ",
  "focus": "Looks acceptable.  I don't think it is tack sharp but I am not looking at a full resolution rendering either so I'll give this the benefit of the doubt.  ",

  "use_of_camera": "The exposure is really nice because it is balanced between the sky and the subject, it's just a tad bit overexposed and causing a light burn in some areas and some motion blur in the hands, which could be good depending on your tastes if you want to underline the movement.",

  "color_lighting": "Color...I definetely love the color of this shot!It's so warm and nice and well balanced with the background, just a little bit too warm, but it can be easily fixed in Photoshop, just be sure to fix it just a little bit because you want to keep the warm tone that makes this picture so nice and welcoming.",
  "focus": "Focus is perfect on the subject and it makes it stand out from everything else as it should, and what seems actually weird to me is that you wrote that you used a Canon Powershot A95 to take this picture.Well I actually used that 5mpixel camera ages ago, mainly during scuba diving and knowing is a compact camera I don't understand how you got the blurred out background and blurred out people standing in front of you. Either you photoshopped and blurred everything or you did not use a compact camera. Nonetheless if you used that camera this is an outstanding result for that 5mixel camera, especially at sunset.",

  "general_impression": "Hi there Janice,really well spotted. I like the way you had an idea for an images and really worked to make it happen. The use of backlight and deep blacks is very dramatic, and the fast shutter speed really emphasises the drama of the pounding ocean. Nothing much I could improve here apart from a bit more separation between the walker and the background ocean. Great job.cheersPaul",
  "subject_of_photo": "A great subject for a photograph, and I like the way you've really thought about the contrasts in the image, not just of tonality but the slow figure vs the pounding ocean.",
  "composition": "I really like how there's some calm ocean at the top of the frame as well. For me it almost symbolizes that there are rough times at the moment but things will calm down eventually. If there is one thing I would work on it is the separation between the man and the dark parts of the ocean. Difficult to do I know, because of so many dark areas of waves, but there are parts of the man's head that disappear into the ocean in the background. If he was a couple of feet to the right he would be perfectly silhouetted. Just a small point but one that I think would improve the picture enormously.",
  "use_of_camera": "Great use of a fast shutter speed to really stop the spray on the waves at the top of the frame. For me this works much better than a slow shutter speed with blurry waves would have. I like the dark underexposure and heavy use of blacks as well.",
  "depth_of_field": "Really nice use of depth of field. Some photographers like a really shallow depth of field but for me, in this type of image, everything in focus is a lot more powerful.",
  "color_lighting": "Great use of backlight and pretty much monochrome except for a slight hint of colour in the sky at the top of the frame. ",
  "focus": "Focus is great too. A large depth-of-field renders everything nice and sharp.",

The muddy water flow from top third left to bottom right is the glue hold this image of yours together and the center yellow leave draws your eye back to center, (main subject)Great textures and Tones on the left half with swirling flows. Great shot  Sharon I like it.",

Even if you have to add a leave, Now I know many will prefer to shoot as is and not play with the subject, however the Pro's and masters do, and it is not over doing things by accomplishing this. The yellow and some red could be added to draw more attention to the image.  One good thing to remember Sharon is that the camera see's with one eye we see with two, having said that  by the above you are only adding to what you saw just as or before you shot this photograph, thus rendering the image as the state it was in.  IF you are able to adjust in adobe vinetting the outer perimeter  will also help draw the eye in more to the center, a  small amount of density. I did take your shot and made these adjustments and  it did help. again Sharon some will not adjust at all, but it is to enhance with in reason to strengthen a photograph.",

However Sharon it may seem cumbersome , but your control and final images will improve.",

If the bird, for instance, had been shot an an angle where the camera was head on to him, it would have provided a little more depth and movement to the image I think.",

The light, obviously, was coming from slightly left and shone directly on the bird.  The bird is captured well but the white feeder is blown out some.  This is not a huge issue. . just a distraction.",

  "general_impression": "Yes I know that I have been harsh on your marks. The picture itself is not bad, there is little wrong with it but you have chosen to dip your toes into the waters that a million photographers and tourists alike have passed through. This as I said earlier has made it doubly difficult for you to take a 'great' Venetian image. Hence from a comparitive point of view of maybe a thousand others it would indeed stand the test but reduce that to hundreds and it would be passed over swiftly. However if I had not been to Venuice and not seen a million pictures of the same thing then I would quite like it! Believe me I have been guilty in 90% of my Venetian shoots of 'sameness' and it is extremely difficult to get 'the shot' but you can, I promise! That is, if you can afford to get back there! Venice without a Gondola is like Havana without a 1957 cadillac on the street corner. There are still great pictures to be taken although viewpoints are running out!",
  "subject_of_photo": "Church of Santa Maria dela Salute taken from  near the Pont della Paglia at the mouth of the Grand Canal with Gondola in forground. ",
  "composition": "I know Venice well and have taken thousands of images there. Most of them I have to admit, cliches and derivatives of someone elses photo ideas. That's the trouble with such famous settings: you really have to be specific and extremely selective in what you shoout to make your ideas stand out and I feel that I have to mark you down a little for not really making an eye-popping image.I feel that the composition is a little flat: not a bad thing in itself but there is no focal point. My eye goes from the church to the boat and constantly roams without being able to settle anywhere. A closer crop may have helped. Going past the protective boom and a little further along the facade of the Doge's Palace would have given you closer access to the Gondolas thereby getting a bigger forground image and still using the church as a backdrop.",
  "use_of_camera": "1/75 second at F8. You obviously switched to the 'P' setting or even 'A' setting on your canon. Why? You should always shoot the 'big' pictures on 'M' so that you can use the full scope of the camera's settings. I feel that this image could have done with a little under exposure to give the feeling of dusk. I am curious about the 'orange' sky. Was this a graduated 'Cokin' stype filter or was this for real? I feel it was the former but there is little colour bleed on to the cupola of the church which is quite clever! It is actually in danger of looking a little 'muddy'or thundery.",
  "depth_of_field": "Again there is no depth of field. The boat in the forground gives marginal depth to the picture but not nearly enough to make it arresting!",
  "color_lighting": "I kind of like to colours even if they are all a little muted. That underexposure would have made them all a little more vivid but that church can really shine when the sun hits it and it is a little lost behind the Sestiere Dorsoduro.",
  "focus": "Camera set to infinity I assume but its a landscape so you have little choice unless of course you wanted to be really creative and place something larger close to the camera to give the image depth - which is what it lacks.",

There are some muddy shadows along the edges of the photo in the lower half where the snow is located. They don't look natural to me, but I can't say for sure what caused them.  ",
  "depth_of_field": "Appears to be sharp through the image, though not quite perfect. It is always hard to tell with images on the web, which may appear softer because they are not rendered at maximum resolution.

There is always a confluence of line, form, hue and elements that while retaining its iconic value as a shot that resonates with people, still manages to provide a unique set of lines and textures for each image captured.  This image is very compelling.  There is a lot going on but it doesn't detract from the overall serenity and clarity of the scene. ",
  "composition": "The primary leading lines here form a nice converging perspective plane for the eye to sort of climb on and ride from foreground to horizon. I think the perspective or point of view from which the image was captured works well too as it allows the viewer a low birds eye view of the scene yet provides a view of the pier walks that allows a clear and unobstructed leading line from the lower right of the image into the distance.  The stacked horizontal boats act as buffers for the eye to rest upon before moving deeper into the frame and ultimately to the distant horizon.

The result is not unpleasant and in fact presents sort of a tone mapped quality that you see in HDR and multi-image exposures.  The sky, which has some wonderful cloud elements in it however experiences some blown cloud highlights. This isn't always a bad thing, particularly on cloud edges or small specular highlights within the clouds.  But in this case there are some fairly substantial blown areas of the large cloud lobes that tend to detract from the otherwise beautifully detailed clouds and sky.  ",

  "general_impression": "Hi Sophie, Nice work isolating these two subjects and avoiding any potentially distracting elements. The out of focus background really makes the ladybugs pop out.

  "subject_of_photo": "The composition makes it clear what the subject is and hold the viewer's attention.",
  "composition": "Shooting from a low angle shows the subjects from the level at which they see the world, creating a realistic, documentary feel. The negative space created by the out of focus areas is a good balance to the well defined subjects. This gives the subjects breathing room and the image a feeling of openness, while still having the attention remain clearly on the subjects. There is a split in the wood near the ladybugs which trails down to the bottom left corner. To make that line more dominant crop off the bottom of the image to have that line go directly into the corner.",

  "depth_of_field": "The shallow depth of field works well to keep the attention on the subjects. If the critical placement of the focus (as mentioned in the Focus section above) is challenging at a wider aperture, it would be worth it to try f/8 or f/11. The question would be will the background stay out of focus enough.",
  "color_lighting": "The red color of the ladybugs stands out nicely against the other colors in the image. The diffused lighting produces a soft quality of light that compliments the subjects, and makes it easier to work with a slightly high contrast subject.",
  "focus": "Careful placement of the point of focus is critical with macro photography as you're often dealing with minimal depth of field. The ladybugs are clearly the sharpest part of the image. The question is where on the ladybugs to focus. I find the ladybug on the right draws more attention and I would look to have the sharpest part be the near side of the \"face\" of that ladybug. It does not appear this is quite the sharpest part of the image. A small shift in focus would better direct the viewer's attention.",

I tried this and it does shoe more  and help balance the photograph.  The top leaning tree helps to give a reverse s curve to encase the photo as a  whole.

  "general_impression": "John I like this image.  It is both pleasing to the eye, and evokes a very majestic and peaceful mood as well. I think the compositional elements are all very good.  The lighting was difficult and I have found in Yosemite that morning and evening light, while the most dramatic, is also the most problematic due to the large dynamic range you are trying to capture, and the complexity of shadows inherent in forest settings.  Below are some ideas you might wish to consider in post processing as well as in initial capture in the future.   ",
  "subject_of_photo": "Hello John. Yosemite and Halfdome are always compelling subjects and in this case I think you've captured the majesty and the beauty of the land very well.  I like all the elements you have going on in the image and the way that you've included the iconic Halfdome geologic structure as more of a backdrop to the image and not the main focus.  ",
  "composition": "Overall I like the composition of the image.  I like the placement of Halfdome in the right third part of the image, and the balance provided by the lines of the Merced River as it moves in the composition from left to right and upwards into the mountains and under the bridge.  You've framed the composition well with the trees  on either side and connected nicely with the bridge.  I'm not sure I love the amount of obscuring of Halfdome by the tree branches, but sometimes you just get what you get in a landscape photo depending on how mobile you can be.",
  "use_of_camera": "I think the exposure is a bit dark.  As a print you'd need to bump it up a bit or its going to get real muddy I think.  Looking at your data, I can see that your lighting was pretty much winter light, with the sun low in the west and providing great illumination for the higher elevations and tree tops but very little for the foreground and river bank portions of the image.  The resulting tonal range you're trying to capture is probably along the area of 7 or 8 or more stops and the camera effectively deals with about 5 well.  So naturally something has to give, either the highlights or the shadows.  In this case you've opted to keep the shadows dark to not blow out the highlights.  But the foreground trees lose a lot of their detail and form, particularly on the far left and right margins of the lower 2/3rds of the image.  The river is a bit dark as well, but not so noticeably because it reflects the light from the highlighted trees.  This is a great candidate for an HDR approach (True, multiple image HDR to be specific and not the tone mapped version also contained in Photoshop).  ",
  "depth_of_field": "Good.",
  "color_lighting": "I like the colors in this image, and despite the amount of shadow, it is not overly blue as you might expect (but does have a blue/magenta cast in the shadows of the snow).  I do see some yellow cast in the lower right snow bank.  I believe this to be reflected light from the trees and river reflections. The image also is contrasty by nature, mostly because of the late day light, and the tonal range you tried to capture in one shot.  ",

  "general_impression": "Lily, thanks for choosing me to critique your image. It's a pity that you have chosen to watermark it because the watermark gets in the way when I'm trying to evaluate the image and imagine what it looks like without that distraction.The data above says that the original image was 375x500 pixels. I imagine that's a mistake because all cameras these days are capable of capturing at a higher resolution that that.  375x500 pixels is about 1/5th of a megapixel!  I realise that you may have inadvertently set your camera to capture at one of its low resolution settings and you've had to go with what you got.Nevertheless, the large version of the image reveals itself to be 1200x1600 pixels when I examine it in an image editor. The conclusion I draw from this, Lily, is that you have resized (upsampled) the 375x500 pixel image to 1200x1600 and uploaded it. That's quite an upsize, and the result is that the image looks soft. It lacks definition in the details.But let's get past that and look at the image in general terms as a piece of visual communication. You wanted to convey the impression of an unexpected portrait of a person taking a distant look through a doorway while there were many people passing in the street; and perhaps the idea that this old lady was alone and frail.I think you've captured some of those things in this image. She looks concerned and alone to me. However, there is no clue in the image that she's being passed by, or ignored by other people in the street. Perhaps if the image showed a blurred glimpse of a passer by on one side of the frame the impression of the woman being ignored would be strong.Timing is everything in photojournalistic images like this. I realise that you may have spontaneously grabbed this photographic opportunity, and that you probably would have felt awkward if you'd stayed there longer waiting for all of the elements in your imagined story to come together to make the title \"Young trapped in an old coccoon\" resonate. I do get the feeling that the old lady has been sidelined from society more than that of a young-at-heart lady trapped in an old body.I wish you all the best with your photography, Lily. I feel you have a sensitive eye and that's an asset for any photographer.If it moves you, shoot it!Rob Smith AAPS",
  "subject_of_photo": "The subject of a woman looking out of a doorway with a concerned expression on her face is clear and obviously has the human interest factor. I assume that the snake motif is supposed to be a watermark to protect the intellectual property of the image? I'm afraid it does get in the way of viewing and appreciating the photograph. I recommend that images be submitted without such large watermarks.",
  "composition": "The composition is bold and doesn't follow accepted norms. Nothing wrong with that! I like the composition in this case. It has visual tension with half of the woman's body obscured by the door opening, and her gaze crossing the vertical vectors of the door and doorway lines. The verticals are parallel (not converging) and that's good too. If they converged, they would complicate and weaken the composition in my view.",
  "use_of_camera": "Unfortunately there is no technical data (EXIF) included with the image that would allow me to properly evaluate your choice of camera mode and controls. Exposure looks OK and you seem to have captured a good tonal range for the ensuing black and white conversion. The woman's pants may be overexposed on the upper thigh but it's not in a way that detracts from the image. The pants are believably pure white.",
  "depth_of_field": "Depth of field seems prefectly adequate for this image, albeit with the same reservations expressed under 'Focus'. That is, the image has other problems that are probably masking the true appearance of the depth of field.",
  "color_lighting": "I feel that the monochrome conversion is quite good and the indirect lighting on the woman's face has allowed you to make a pleasing environmental portrait. The semi side-lighting reveals character in the woman's face.",
  "focus": "The image appears to be adequately in focus where it counts. However, there are technical issues related to the processing of the image that make it impossible to tell whether focus was spot on in the original capture. I'll discuss the technical issues later.",

  "general_impression": "Denis, once again a good effort, nice composition, and the colors, tones and textures make this an interesting and attractive image (and a nice companion image to the sunset shot earlier). I think your exposure could have been a little faster to perhaps overcome the blown highlights in the ice areas of the image, but overall this is a very nice image.  ",
  "subject_of_photo": "Great. This would make a nice companion photo to your sunset image of the same scene.  The same things apply to this image, relative to subject matter, as the first.  ",
  "composition": "Again, not much more to say about the composition and perspective than in the other image. But I see in this one there is a lone individual standing at the end of the point of land on the right hand side of the image.  At first I thought he shouldn't be there, but then I realized that before I saw him I didn't have any idea as to the size of the ice or the scope of the scene.  So in that regard I think the person is less of a distraction and more of a place-mark to provide scope and perspective. Although it is difficult to see, I don't think the picnic table works well however next to the man and would remove that in post processing. But not critical.  As in the other image I like the movement that the water creates as it moves into the calm area behind the icebergs.  There is a story to that and a metaphorical sense of troubled waters leading to resolution you could say.  Its more of a story with the contradictory elements than without them.  ",
  "use_of_camera": "Pretty much works except that the white tones in the ice remnants in the middle foreground and in the distance are blown out from overexposure and there's not any practical way to recover them since in some areas they have gone to pure white.  Fortunately this isn't a huge problem because they don't represent a single and dominating subject that would require that the detail be obvious.  But they still are a bit of a bright distraction because of this.  ",
  "depth_of_field": "Good. f/11 is within the 'story' aperture range.  By this I mean an aperture that provides sufficient detail throughout the image from foreground to infinity to allow for many elements to come to play and interact within the composition and allow the viewer to see it as a themed visual dialog. On the other hand, a macro-closeup shot simply 'displays' an object and presents it as sort of a focused, showcased form with a soft and diffused background. ",
  "color_lighting": "I like the colors in this one as well. Compared to your sunset image of the same setting, it is amazing how different the colors, and thus the mood, can be in the period of 24 hours. In this image the tones are all cool and vibrant greens, aquas and blues.  It is a much different composition as a result, simply because of the color and light differences. I am also attracted to the red/brown hues and detail of the rock along the land spits on either side of the composition.  They nicely frame the composition and direct the eye into the image and with the flow of the water in the foreground. ",

It looks like there is a church steeple in there that could have been all the skyline needed for more drama but at the moment its just too small and insignificant.

This an effective way to pull the viewer into the frame.  You included bright sky and being much brighter than the rest of the scene shouts for attention with no detail to give the viewer.

  "focus": "Probably because you used an IPhone to capture the image, you didn't have control of focus and the image appears soft vice sharp.  Because it appears that the image wasn't exposed in bright sunlight (it appears as slightly overcast because of no harsh shadow/light transitions-good conditions for photography) you might try holding the phone/camera against something solid to further steady it and add to chances of reducing camera motion which happens to some extent at all shutter speeds and when touching or pushing the \"doohickey\" shutter release.",

I would like to see you use a portrait lens next time to minimize any distortion on her hand and face. ",

It says your focal length was 5mm which I have never seen before. I tried to look it up but it looks like they are used mostly for binoculars, telescopes or security cameras.  I have an 8mm circular fisheye which is super wide, but this doesn't look like that either, so what I can guess is that you used a wide angle lens, maybe similar to a 20mm? Anyway - using a wide angle lens for portraiture usually doesn't do the subject any favors and distorts things. Her face looks really wide compared to her lower body, as well as her hand by her face.

Its not a 'rule' so to speak, but my eye senses the boat is moving and running out of space to the right.

  "subject_of_photo": "I have many hummingbird moths in my garden (different markings) which belong to the same family (Sphingidae) as this beautiful creature and I know how difficult they are to photograph - they just never keep still! So I applaud you for capturing this shot - I think you must have been very patient and the setting for this wonderful little insect is perfect.",
  "composition": "It's a nice, straightforward angle, top down, showing us the context in which the moth is feeding so I think it works well. I would have liked the moth to fill the picture more but I know how difficult it can be to get a capture and I think you have done really well.",
  "use_of_camera": "The wings are a nice soft blur which shows us they are in motion but the body of the moth is not sharp enough. It's impossible to get something like this very sharp without choosing a fast shutter speed to freeze the motion. If you use manual settings you can choose the shutter speed you want (especially on a sunny day with good light like this was). I would suggest 1/250th of a second or 1/500th to at least get the body of the moth sharp. Exposure looks good. Can't comment on focal length as the data has not been given.",
  "depth_of_field": "Depth of field is shallow as only the foreground is remotely sharp. With this particular composition it would have been better to get everything sharp so a larger depth-of-field is needed such as f/5.6 or more.",
  "color_lighting": "The colour and lighting are perfect. I love the pale, salmon pink colour on the wings amid the green leaves and deep pink flowers. Beautiful. (I am assuming you have used auto White Balance which is fine for sunny days like this.)",
  "focus": "It looks like the focus is on the foreground, not the insect. If you use autofocus, the camera will choose the object nearest the lens, which is what seems to have happened here. It's difficult with a moving subject to use manual focus but the other options are single point focussing and tracking the insect (difficult) or focussing on the flower and waiting for the insect to arrive (also difficult!). Whatever you do it's going to be a challenge every time.",

  "general_impression": "A really quietly funny image that we can all relate to because we have been there: annoyed and yet resigned to the inevitable.  A post production crop adjustment and some dodge and burn to the eye  can  reinforce the story and take this image to the next level. ",
  "subject_of_photo": "Good subject and a great story to go with it.  Recognizing the humor and story in the annoyance of a fly shows you have an eye for photography",
  "composition": "You have grabbed the fly in a great position relative to the horse.  The line from the eye to the fly is a nice diagonal across the center of the image. Had it been buzzing around the eye or  face it would have been confused in detail.  A suggesting would be to play with the cropping.  If your original image is larger, I would try a crop that includes a little bit more of the face by moving the existing crop over to the right and down a bit.  The difference in lighting on the neck and face make a half and half effect right down the center of the image  - another reason to try a different crop",

  "depth_of_field": "In my opinion, more depth of field would help this image.  The eye, cheek, and fly would all be more detailed  if you adjusted the ISO up, the aperture up to F 8 - 11  and the increased the shutter speed.   ",

If you change the shutter, you must also compensate in the ISO and aperture to maintain your lighting.  The neck needs to be dark in this photo to highlight the fly,  but adjusting the crop to include more of the face will bring a bit more brightness to the overall image",
  "focus": "The focus seems a bit soft.  THis is most likely do to no tripod and the fast shutter.  Since it is nearly impossible to focus on a buzzing fly, you must focus on the second subject - the eye.  then click away whenever the fly enters the same focal plane.  A tripod removes one more element of movement  and allows you the best chance to use a fast shutter effectively.  Even a monopod in your camera bag will help when faced with unexpected action photography opportunities",

  "general_impression": "Hello Gillian, First of all thank you for selecting me to critique your wonderful shot of this bird.The rich color of the bird's chest and head have the elements that give your impact and demand viewer eyes attention. Use of a diagonal split of composition is something that make your image peaceful and balanced.",
  "subject_of_photo": "Gillian, first of all I'm very glad that you have a lot of various birds in your garden. It means that \"civilization\" still didn't ruined your neighborhood. This bird was good subject, even it makes \"face\" for good image. Good cooperation between you and model.",
  "composition": "The branch and bird's tail feathers gives parallel perspective throw image diagonal. That way you managed to give us balanced composition. You have a double triangle composition. As I can see you crop photo, and you do it in a good way.",
  "use_of_camera": "Gillian, the result is better that it could be expected with this elements. I really don't know this camera, but I don't see a lot of noise as it can be expected with ISO 3200. Maybe you eliminated that noise editing photo in your computer, but you did it very skillfully. Even, you had 1/100 sec, but the image is sharp enough. If you didn't use tripod, I must admit that you have very steady hand. Usage of long focal length as 300 mm is, can be very tricky.",
  "depth_of_field": "You could have better effect with lower F than 5.6, but maybe this aperture is all your lens can do. Anyway, not bad.",
  "color_lighting": "Gillian, the rich color and color dynamic range of the bird is very good. The orange color of bird's chest is very striking, and that part makes the rest of the image almost B&W.",
  "focus": "I have a little remark about focus, because few parts of the branch are more sharp then the bird's beak or eye. I can understand that was the best you could do, because if there was a little breeze in your garden, branch was moving and running out of focus.",
  "description": "I love watching the wild birds in my garden, so try to capture as many as I can with my camera.",

  "general_impression": "Hello Drake and thanks for choosing me to provide feedback on your shot. The subject is a nice one. The Red Panda spends lots of time either feeding or resting and tends not to move too quickly so fast shutter speeds are rarely required which means you can concentrate on the depth of field, manual focus or at least focal point selection. Cutting in close with this shot has lost a little of the character of the Panda's ears which add nice contrast to the reds and blacks and would help to frame him better. In all this is a good shot and a couple of fairly minor adjustments would make this a great shot.",
  "subject_of_photo": "Nice shot of a Red Panda.... which isn't really a panda, not even a bear, more closely related to raccoons and weasels. It has great colours and when you can see its ears, they have nice white 'halo's'",

  "depth_of_field": "Depth of field is probably at the limit of what your lens will allow but is just about right for this shot. You obviously want to bring out the facial features but this must be done sensitively taking into account the focal point. You may want to increase the f stop to f9 and ensue the nose and eyes are crisp.I hope you find my comments helpful and if you would like to ask anything about my critique, feel free to contact me via the messaging service.RegardsKen",

  "focus": "Focus on the nose is great and the shine of his wet nose is very nice but the eyes should always be the main point of focus. I'm guessing that you have used an auto focus rather than manual and the AF has just picked up on whatever you have pointed at rather than you selecting a focal point.",

The background is mostly clear of elements but the books in the left and the line of the ceiling are a bit distracting as is the dark item behind the cat's shoulder. Removing these will let the viewer concentrate on the fish.  The angle looking up at the scene is a good idea and strengthens the image ",

You can take some of the orange cast out in post production.

You would have eliminated the long, \"hot\" (i.e. blown out by the sun) strip of grass at the right and also the distracting, broken foliage (top left) had you shot from this perspective. I gather this was late morning judging from the direction of the light. You may have seen this and it gave you a warm feeling in your heart thus motivating you to capture it. It looks like you caught his attention and his gaze may have followed you had you moved to the right.",
  "use_of_camera": "I would have used a faster shutter speed and a larger aperture to capture this. The speed would have avoided any camera shake (not that there is any camera shake present) and the wide aperture provided a needed shallow depth of field. My preference would have been to use a wider aperture (maybe 2.5) allowing for an even shallower depth of field and faster shutter speed.",
  "depth_of_field": "The f5.6 aperture allowed for a nice shallow depth of field. It is not blurred totally in the background and also not sharp enough to create a distraction. I would have recommended a larger aperture to you had I been there.",
  "color_lighting": "I really like the contrast between the darkness of the animal and the bright green of the foliage. There is detail in both the dark and light tones of the image. Although the strand of foliage at right is very hot, this may be eliminated by cropping it out.",
  "focus": "The subject, while slightly soft, is in acceptable focus. I suggest to almost everyone I meet to play around with their images in post-processing. Focus just a bit more. Bump up the colors a bit. You would be surprised with what you end up with and you may develop a new technique! :)It's very difficult to get an image that is \"tack sharp\" with a digital SLR and even more so when you do not use a tripod (or a monopod).",

  "general_impression": "Leonard, I tend to be rather stingy with my critique evaluation numbers, but I think that this effort has the look of a classic composition.  I was reminded of some iconic Japanese wall tapestry as I looked at it. My suggestions are not complaints by any means but my thoughts on how you could improve this image even more.  ",
  "subject_of_photo": "Leonard, your eye was right.  I like the way the main subject, in this case the grouping of three lily stalks, thrusts forth from the water and provides the sense of motion, strength and growth.  Often times close-up flower images tend to be simply pretty but static.   ",
  "composition": "The placement of the subject in the image is technically balanced and as a result intrinsically pleasing.  It is well balanced and the fact that there are three lily blooms as opposed to two, or four or more, works very well. I realize you didn't create this. .but you did see it in your creative minds eye.  Also being at ground level (or frog level perhaps), gives a different and other worldly effect to the image.  If you had taken the image standing up looking down at the scene, it would not have had the impact that it does.  ",
  "use_of_camera": "The levels histogram (using PS CS6) shows that right out of the camera the highlights (in this instance the lily petals) are over-exposed and there is some clipping and loss of image detail in the areas that have gone pure white. Overall however the image is dark, which is to be expected considering the environment you were shooting in.  In fact it is a compelling lighting scenario that is correspondingly difficult to expose correctly with one capture.  The tonal range of this image is very extended and so the camera does the best it can to try to get everything exposed correctly.  In this case it opted to blow out the small highlights and expose the rest of the scene relatively well.  I'm guessing you were shooting aperture priority or full automatic.  In any case the camera is going to struggle to give you a perfect exposure considering the tonal range you were looking at capturing.  I'll discuss this a bit in the critique section below as to how to deal with this both up front, and after the fact in post processing.  The white balance looks good to me.  ",
  "depth_of_field": "Very nice.  The foreground is in focus and then softens as the eye moves to the background.  This effectively deepens the scene and gives a sense of depth and substance to the image.  ",
  "color_lighting": "These colors are subtle and pleasing and complement the design elements nicely.  They are, also, the colors you would expect to find in such a setting so there isn't any disconnect between what is represented color wise, and what the eye would 'expect' to see. I like the subtle tones of greens and rusts contrasted against a deep, almost black, green backdrop. It appears you shot at mid afternoon looking at the lack of cast shadow.  This is an advantage in such a composition in that it doesn't create any distracting lines or shadows and allows the simple composition to shine through. The disadvantage of afternoon shooting is that the light is very harsh, and while there are less shadows cast, it tends to obliterate highlights if there are any.  You can see where it started to do that with the petals.    ",
  "focus": "Looking at the larger resolution image available with this critique, it appears to me that the focus is pretty good and appropriately placed on the flowers. The stamens are, ultimately, sharp and clear as are the petals and stalks. (I couldn't tell however until I opened your image in Photoshop Camera Raw and adjusted the levels and highlights to eliminate the highlight blowouts on the leaves) I'll discuss this below. ",

Keep working at this, make a photo a day (by shooting many in a day and choosing the best one), After 1 month you'll have a portfolio of 30 feet photos.",
  "subject_of_photo": "Photographing feet, especially babies feet, can be delightful, rewarding and challenging. Somewhat similar to hands, feet have an iconography, (a symbolic representation), that connect us to the earth, that bring us places, and even contain gestures -somewhat like hand- that tell us storiess. While feet can be a strong subject, I feel that this composition, with some forethought, could have better conveyed that.",
  "composition": "A strong composition is one that either leads us through the photograph (kind of takes our eyes on a path). It can be symmetrical or asymmetrical. It will contain a balance that is better felt than explained. While not a carved in stone rule, research and review the 'rule of thirds' and the 'golden mean'. While this composition starts to work in the 'rule of thirds', there are some strong distractions that erode this photo. 1st the area in the upper left and lower right. They are dark areas that while helping direct our eyes inward towards the subject (sort of creating a vignetting) they offer no information that strengthens the subject and like the spherical object above the right foot tends to distract us. Those corner areas are so dark that they just sit like heavy blocked up areas.",
  "use_of_camera": "Lens: I think either a wider lens (shorter mm) or moving a bit further back from the subject could have increased the compositional strength of this photo. With a shutter speed of 25 motion blur may occur either due to movement of the subject of the photographers hands, increase your iso if you do not have enough light to achieve a higher shutter speed.",
  "depth_of_field": "I am so distracted by the out of focus foot in the foreground, had that been in focus and the foot that is in focus slightly out of focus, I feel would have been a far stronger use of DoF.",
  "color_lighting": "The lighting is OK and came from the rear, this adds shape and texture but also makes those 'blocked up' shadowed area in the foreground, a small reflector such as an 8x10 white card near the feet, just out of frame, could have opened this area just enough. I do like the use of B&W.",
  "focus": "Our eyes will always naturally go to the sharpest area of a photo.  While the right foot is sharp (little and cute), my attention is drawn away by the shallow depth of field (DoF), and the out of focus in the foreground. Additionally the angle this photo was made, foreshortens the foot in the foreground, increasing it's distractive qualities.",
  "description": "I love feet and none better than babies!  I am trying to be a little different than the norm as well and I do love b & W.",

This is a great image, I'd like to see you take some time to soften the contrast a little, such stark black and white detracts from the message of love that you are trying to portray.  (even though I do like the contrast!) Changing the crop will also help - her leg is very distracting and the hat is too bright, also distracting.  You want their faces to be the first thing you notice when you look at the image, and a bright spot will always pull the eye there first.  His hand on his thigh also detracts from the message you are trying to portray.  All of this is a pretty easy fix by cropping tighter.  Keep up the good work. :) ",

  "composition": "As stated  above the crop is a bit off. a tighter crop just their faces would do much to bring more attention to the love they are expressing with their looks, it would also remove the super bright hat at the bottom of the frame, and alleviate the cramped feel of the image overall. There is too much goin on around them to let your eyes focus on the true subject of the image.  You have a lot of lines leading into their heads, the pipe, the boards of the wall, finding another location for them to sit would have probably helped the image overall. ",

One \"rule\" is that you should never put the main subject of interest directly in the center of the image because the eye tends to grab onto it and get stuck there.  This is what happens in this photograph with the sailboat.  Ideally you want to set up a photograph so that the eye travels through the image.  It would have been better if, say, you had framed the photograph so that the sailboat was on the left-hand side of the shot.  This would have been more appealing because we could imagine the sail boat moving from left to right across the frame.",

You lose a little color, but that is OK, there is plenty of color left it focuses the image right into the bee. Perspective: you usually want to shoot at eye level of living things. Bug eyes are tough and changing the angle may have lost the blue colors.  ",

  "focus": "Great job, eyes have to be in focus and they are. Good depth of field, blurring the background made the bee pop out. If you would have had full depth of field, the bee may have blurred right into the image.",

  "general_impression": "Hi Douglas,  I like this image for its overall feel.  I think some of the details relative to action and lighting could be enhanced some.

Below are some things you may wish to consider.",
  "subject_of_photo": "City Street scenes that include intimate crowds, traffic, cafes, traffic and such, particularly when they are rendered in Black and White, evoke a classic and retro, old school mood.

  "composition": "I like the point of view here, situated inside the cafe, looking out, as it were, from a portal into another world. There are a lot of interesting lines, forms, textures and shadows here that to some degree work well, and to some degree fight each other as well. You have some vertical line distortion on your door and left side frame of the opening of the caf, and some horizontal distortion on the top frame of the awning at the top of the frame.  There is a space above the awning as well that sort of distracts from the main part of the composition.  There is a nice left to right virtual horizontal leading line on the right lower portion of the frame, formed by the stone walkway and it framing by the tables and chairs on either side of it. This brings the eye into the scene from the bottom of the frame quite well.  Other factors here are the people who not only form the 'story' based upon their unique positions, actions, movements and expressions.  In this case your image is rather static in that regard. All the people are either sitting or standing and looking away from the camera.  The only exceptions are pretty obscure, and they are a woman on the far right of the frame neat the table, and a man in the middle of the street.  What all have in common is they are doing absolutely nothing. The lack of any sort of expression or movement by any of the subjects to me makes the image less dynamic than it would had one of the people been turning, been slightly in blur, engaged in conversation with someone next to them, etc. ",

  "composition": "Pepe, I would like to see a vertical of this image using the left and right pillars to frame the tower.  The full frame image is too much information.  The photo is divided into 4 parts due to the strong vertical lines of the left and right pillars.  I would like to see the image less busy and this could be accomplished by either going vertical or cropping the right side sky out of the image and using the right pillar as a frame to hold the viewer's eye on the subject.  The wide angle of the image is causing a the pillars to tilt in towards the center of the image.  In architectural photography it is very important to hold the true lines and perspective.  You might want to invest in a tilt and shift lens to maintain the true perspective.",

Using a 19mm focal length and F9, I would expect to see a sharp buildings in the image.  The image was processed in Adobe Lightroom so some sharpening should have been applied.  Some of the lack of sharpness can be attributed to the lens you used.",

It seems like you've taken this picture from a moving car with camera pointed out of window with your hand shaking. Miguel, this subject deserves much more TLC!! ;) It deserves first, a bit  more time to capture it right.

There are also some strange artefacts around the edges of the rocks and mountains which could support my theory about poorly upsizing technique.

  "general_impression": "Hi Susan, You spotted a glorious moment with sun shining brightly in the sky and reflecting on the water. I think the potential is there with this scene, but I feel it suffers from a lack of compositional focus. The viewer's eye is not sure where to look. I think going for a tighter composition with a smaller section of the far trees as silhouettes and the sun above would have been more effective.",
  "subject_of_photo": "It is clear this is a landscape photo, but it is not clear what about the landscape you most wanted to share with the viewer. The sun overly dominates the images, making it hard to pay attention to much else.",
  "composition": "The basic structure of the composition has potential in that there is a foreground, middle ground and background. However, there is not much of interest in the foreground and it is hard to see detail in the background trees because they are so dark. The tree branches in the top left corner are a distraction because they do not connect to anything else in the composition. The eye ends up being drawn to the sun and largely ignoring the rest of the image.",
  "use_of_camera": "With the sun very bright and high in the sky it creates extremely high contrast conditions. Unfortunately, there is not a way to maintain good detail in the sky and the far trees is a single exposure. You could shoot multiple exposures and blend them together using software.",
  "depth_of_field": "The depth of field appears to have brought everything into focus. Although using an aperture of f/4 is usually for selective focus applications. For landscape images aim for at least f/8. However due to different camera models and sensor sizes, f/4 may have been adequate in this situation.",
  "color_lighting": "As touched on in the Exposure section, the lighting conditions present the biggest challenge for this image. Shooting this scene at a different time of day when the light was not as intense and/or coming from a different direction could have provided better results. Otherwise if something is going to be pure black (or close to it), look for a way to use the silhouette as a strong compositional element.",

  "general_impression": "John, This image has some wonderful elements.  I think that as a cohesive composition it doesn't work as well. I do think there are things you could have done initially at capture to improve the image, and things you can do in post processing to take advantage of this images inherent qualities.  ",
  "subject_of_photo": "John, As much as I think this image has potential, I'm going to have to say, as presented, its just okay.  I can absolutely see what drew you to this image, but I think it is fairly unremarkable, and lacks what I would consider a solid main point of focus. (I don't mean true focus, but rather a subject that compels the eye to go there, and that defines the images 'story'. I think the way the elements fill the frame space, it isn't abstract enough to take advantage of the nice lines and forms and make them the subject. ",
  "composition": "I think that the composition here is such that it defeats the presence of very strong and compelling shapes, forms and textures that reside within the frame.  I just don't think they are presented in a thoroughly cohesive manner, and the lines and forms don't seem to work as well as they could.  For instance, the roofline on that interesting and compelling structure emmanates from the middle of the left frame (not the strongest entry point for a leading line), and terminates in mid sky line.  My eye wants it to join up with another line and continue taking me on some visual excursion.  Rather, it ends abruptly in the blue.  On a positive note, I do like the very nice alignment of the horizontal two by four in the shed structure, with the horizontal earth line in the background, as well as the repeating horizontal of the lighter grassy background line beyond. Similarly you have juxtaposed vertical lines in the sheds ribbing, and nice soft bending diagonals on the aluminum roof.  I also like the use of similar dark browns in the earth to mimic the color of the side of the shed, and the nice conical diagonals of the earth that tend to provide visual balance for the diagonal of the rooftop of the structure. I think that the meat of this compositionis the lower left quadrant of the frame and could well stand on its own as an art object.  I think in this case the plain blue sky simply acts as sort of a sink hole, drawing attention from the real meat of this image, lines of the shed, earth and grass.  ",
  "use_of_camera": "",
  "depth_of_field": "The depth of field here somewhat baffles me.  It almost looks like you used a tilt shift lens because the background DOF runs from sharp in the foreground and middle background, to soft and rather unfocused in the grassy area before the hills, then the hills look as if they are in sharper relief.  But then the shed that rises up through all of the focal areas, is in focus throughout, which to me indicates that the focus wasn't a function of lens, but of software.  I'm guessing that you have made a selection around those areas you wished to be in focus and selectively sharpened them.  This seems to be most evident in the rocky mounds as they seem a little sharper than the rest of the composition.  Also there seems to be some smudging or blurring at the topmost outer vertical edge of the building as if there was a less than perfect selection made also there is some haloing at the edge of the roof line rafter ends.  But I can't be sure what has caused this so if I'm off base here I apologize.  Some of these observations don't have to do with DOF but they are relevant nonetheless.  ",
  "color_lighting": "The overall lighting is even, but looks a little flat to me.  It appears as if you were shooting at a time of day with few shadows.  As a result there is little definition in the detail areas of the image.  I think some side lighting would have improved the image here. The colors are very nice and there is a very good tonal tie in with the building and the earth tones in the background.  I think that the side of the structure could have used a little more exposure, and this probably you'd have to do with fill flash or wait till the sun could light it up more. ",

  "general_impression": "Very beautiful photograph Mary! You do have a good sense for outdoors, landscapes and open shots. That is the harder to do because with an open shot we have less chances of selecting an appealing composition, it's not as obvious and although it might as creative as having a telephoto selecting the spot and composing accordingly the skill needed to make such wide open shots really work is big and sophisticated. God work!What I thing is not working for it to be awesome here is the background. It's too much present due to it's imposing density and that Is taking a lot from this photograph. The original needs work in the contrast, yes, but if I compare this with the original I would go to the original and start doing it all over again. Be careful with too much darkening!Anyway, this is a great shot that you should keep working on till it get perfect!See you soon,Cheers",

A purse would complete the outfit - one of those popular great big bags. That would help to give a greater sense of action of the upper body (she's too static from the waist up) to go along with the lower parts. A model agency wants to see movement and flexibility in the prospective model, not just a pretty face. They want to see who can \"sell\" the product with posture and body language. ",
  "composition": "The position in the frame and the cropping is more of a catalog shot than magazine - lifestyle. The NY Times Style magazine is a good example of some of the best advertising fashion right now. I love the Hermes ads. So was catalog your objective? The low angle emphasizes the model's best feature - the legs (as opposed to a traditional portrait angle, which for full length is usually about bust high or slightly higher. If you're going for this model's portfolio, You could slim down the crop to match the pose and lessen the bricks.",

In some catalogs you'll see location shots with landmarks or landscapes. But these backgrounds are never fully in focus; give them a little blur, because what is being sold is the garment. Lifestyle is not just secondary, but tertiary. Note that the actual location chosen has great elements, but also works against you for this purpose. A pillar made of stucco would have eliminated this problem, because we would not look at it. As it is, the eye goes to the bricks - a bright, repeated, prominent pattern.In the distance the building also has strong vertical, eye catching lines. A good way to see exactly what I mean: squint your eyes at the image, and you'll perceive that the most visible parts are not the model. If this is a portfolio picture for the model, again you want an art director to look at her, not say, gee, I vacationed there last year.",
  "color_lighting": "Nice, nice, nice. Did you realize that the fabulous directional lighting makes the model look even better than her great appearance? Often you'll see totally flat lighting on fashion - mostly I don't think this approach works well to create ambience. It's, well, flat. This is what we call great \"rounding\" of the subject, and mostly you were conscientious of looking for the light, and then adding a bit of fill.",
  "focus": "Focus here is a problem, but not for the reason you'd think. You nailed the focus - but there's too much of it! Read down in depth of field. So I'm awarding points for sharp, but taking points away later.",

  "general_impression": "I find this image to have a lot of appeal. It tells a good story of what it's like being a kid, especially a young boy, in the expression and pose, and the simple composition with no distracting elements allows the viewer to focus their attention on the subject. ",
  "subject_of_photo": "Hi Bob, Kids are very expressive and this guy is no exception. It looks like he's having a fun time with the camera and he's an interesting subject for a photograph. You've made his expression the center of attention in this image and there are no distracting elements.",
  "composition": "For this type of portrait, a centered composition is just fine for me, especially if there are no other elements in the image that suggest a particular activity or place. Here you have a black background which isolates your subject nicely. The pose, with the arms reaching back, is a recognizable pose for young kids, but the crop makes the pose unusual and the arms and elbows seem out of place in one aspect and don't bother me in another. As a general portrait, some people might find that disturbing, but as a fine art portrait, it adds a questioning element where the viewer asks \"What's going on? Why is this boy doing this?\". If you've darkened it down any in Lightroom, could you show more of the right forearm (left side of the image) to balance out the shape? The perspective from above is a good angle for this pose, where you would normally want to be at a lower angle.You might also want to look at a square crop of just the boy's head and face, burning in or removing the backs of his arms to create a simple head shot.",
  "use_of_camera": "Exposure is good, with details in the shadows where needed and no overexposed highlights. For young kids moving around, 1/200 is about the slowest shutter speed that can stop their constant movement. ",
  "depth_of_field": "The depth of field is good, I like that it is fairly shallow, allowing the hair, ears, and most everything behind the face to softly blur into the background. The 50mm 1.8 is a great lens, but has a shallow depth of field and it can be tricky, especially if your subject is moving, to get all the parts you need within the depth of field zone you need.",
  "color_lighting": "I like the black & white treatment. I think it emphasizes the expression and action of this young man better than a color image would. The lighting is very nice. You might consider burning in the brighter right arm (left side of image) maybe 1/4 - 1/2 stop darker, the brightness there tends to draw my eye away from the face.",
  "focus": "The focus seems a little soft on the eyes in particular but a little targeted sharpening on the eyes, nose, mouth, and more overall on the face will take care of that fairly easily since the focus is not too far out. I would recommend sharpening just enough to bring emphasis to the face. The soft focus effect is nice and too much sharpening will make it look unnatural.I don't know if you added blur to the image, but there are some sharp elements in what looks like dirt on the boy's face on his nose and left cheek, which indicate to me there might have been some post-processing blur or these elements could be within your depth of field (they are about the same distance forward as the hair just above his forehead).",
