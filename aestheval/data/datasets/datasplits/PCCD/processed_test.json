  "general_impression": "Hi Lucas,This is definitely not just a quick shot for social media. Don't downplay or underestimate what you've done here. This is clearly a great shot for F&B and I only have a few thing to add.First is the fact that you give me way to little information about the shot itself other that what I can clearly see just by observing the results. Anyone can see this is a low DoF and a great example of that too. But you should have filled in all info about it and I don't even know if this is your camera on auto doing it for you and you just got lucky or if it is you deciding everything to the very last detail, including doing the exposure. I'm guessing that you do know a few things but are still shooting in some sort of priority mode, in this case: aperture. If yes it was the camera doing the exposure and the camera failed you, but this is slightly overexposed.Other than that, congrats for the amazing F&B shot you've got here, it is really industry standard quality, even if it is more on the side of a not very produced type of photography. The light is great and the background works like a charm.Good work!CheersSara",

  "general_impression": "Paige, in general there is nothing very wrong with your image. It's weather condition and post processing that kills it the most! I don't like the tone of it.

I also think that white balance is a bit cold here! Lighting is harsh. You said it's perfect but I say it lacks some finesse - it's too raw! Looking at your capture settings I don't think you took this photo at high noon, maybe it was but it was cloudy. Those water drops on the flower are great but completely unnoticeable because of dull and harsh light. There is only your silhouette visible in a few of them! ;) They should jump out of your image! oh well, I suppose it was a cloudy day... ",

Noon usually gives flat lighting to most subjects - but there are exceptions.I think this shot would look great with side lighting to bring out the texture in the columns and brickwork.",

  "general_impression": "Hello Simon,Overall you have a lovely portrait, and an adorable subject!  I strongly encourage my students to put their camera on manual mode and practice getting a proper exposure.  Camera's don't always make the right decisions, and oftentimes shooting with a predetermined setting can limit your creativity.  Candid shots, especially children, are some of the most rewarding images when you capture their unmasked expressions - and kids make great subjects when you are learning to shoot manually.  They always make you 'think on your feet'!  Keep up the great work. ",
  "subject_of_photo": "This pretty little girl is the clear subject of the photograph and the overall focus is clear and sharp, and she is separated nicely by a blurred background.",
  "composition": "Your subjects eyes are in the middle of the image, and it seems that the camera was slightly below the subjects eye level.  Generally, for an interesting and pleasing portrait, your camera could be slightly above the subjects eye level (especially when working with children)and in people and animals the focus point should almost always be the eyes. The rule of thirds is a great place to start when composing a photograph, in this case, placing the eyes of the child in the upper 1/3 of the frame would have made the composition of this portrait much more pleasing to the eye.",
  "use_of_camera": "The portrait mode was used, so the camera has determined the aperture, and shutter speed.  I strongly recommend to everyone to become proficient shooting on manual mode - it's the very best way to add a creative touch to all of your shots, using light to it's fullest artistic potential.",
  "depth_of_field": "Fantastic use of depth of field!  Great separation of your subject from the background, and using an aperture setting of 5.6 or lower creates the blurred effect of the background.",
  "color_lighting": "The camera was most likely set to auto white balance.  The image is a little too cool, especially for skin tones.  Post processing can add warmth and make your portrait come to life.  Also, the sun looks to be directly overhead, casting harsh shadows on the little face.",
  "focus": "The focus looks clear and sharp, nice blurred background.",

This works great for an \"average\" scene but in a bright scene where almost everything is white or very bright, the camera gets fooled and ends up making the image look darker than it should.

I think the colors might be a little hot and the exposure has blown the detail in the subject's dress.I'm guessing that you might have either used actions or a filter to set the mood of the overall image and while it's attractive, it may have been a little too strong.",

The steady dropping off of focus in the background is excellent and draws attention in on the subject very nicely. I think the wash of flowers merges nicely into the foliage in the background. Still, the subject that close to the centre feels a little wrong. Try cropping a little off the right of the image and see how that works for you.",

I like this image and it has a lot more to offer I think than is obvious from the image presented here.  Below are some thoughts on how to bring some of this images intrinsic beauty to the fore.  ",
  "subject_of_photo": "Hi Leigh, The subject of your image is always a compelling one.  The desert skies in Arches, particularly at sunrise and sunset, are always simply amazing.  In this case I think you captured the sky beautifully, yet there are some other elements of the image that do not stand out as much as they could.  ",
  "composition": "Your horizon line, since you have opted to highlight the sky and the marvelous clouds and 'God beams' emanating from the sun, is placed well.  There are also some nice silhouette shapes from the landscape that provide some nice foreground elements.  I think since you have chosen to represent the foreground in Silhouette, then only the most pronounced geological features really need to be showcased, and in this case its the centermost structures.  The rest of the landscape becomes, in this case, because of the lack of detail, a bit extraneous in my opinion. Also I can see when I increase the shadow detail areas that there are some very subtle and nuanced layers to the landscape that are not quite visible in the current exposure level.  If these were exposed more, either through initial capture or during post processing, there would be an enhanced sense of depth and volume to this image.",
  "use_of_camera": "You obviously had the right camera and a stellar lens for this shot. You don't mention whether you used a tripod here.  If you did then I don't think you made maximum use of the ability to lower your ISO for a less artifacted or noisy image, (not that this image is particularly noisy as shown, but when the shadow areas are brought out in the foreground is where you will see this). I think you could well have captured the sky and also rendered more foreground detail with a different exposure combination here.  I think you could have opened the aperture a bit from f/14 to say f/8 and lowered your ISO to 100 to 200.  With a tripod you could have also chosen to use a much slower shutter speed to bring out some of the foreground elements and layering. ",
  "depth_of_field": "",
  "color_lighting": "The colors, particularly in the sky, are wonderful and vibrant. I think the foreground, while interesting in Silhouette, would provide more interest if there was some detail there as well.

I felt when I first saw this image that it was cropped to tightly on the bottom portion of the frame, and my eye wanted to see more of the lower interior of the church.  But after seeing your RAW image with all the people in the image, I understand what you were trying to do.  I still think the elimination of the people and foreshortening of the lower portion of the church creates a little dissonance, ie, the vestibule on the lower left looks bifurcated (and I think that is one of the very interesting objects because it is lit nicely and has great color.  I do like the way the light bean angles down from the dome and carries the eye up from the lower left of the image, up the beam, then around the dome and down back into the center of the composition.  It creates both a dynamism and centered feel.",

I think most of the interest stimulating ability of this image lies in its ironic nature, that is, a pairing of stark, almost machine symmetry, with a standard, organic landscape setting. But I don't find the image subject particularly compelling or interesting although its perspective alone presents an interesting element.   ",
  "composition": "I normally always find a diminishing 'vanishing point' perspective in an image a surefire winner.  In this case I think that there are a few elements that fight each other.  While the nice perspective of the vine rows invites me to move into the composition and meander move all the way to the hills, I feel somewhat confounded by the random, somewhat skewed and uneven and randomly distributed steel stakes that feel like an obstacles.  Perhaps this is the feeling you were going for and if so you succeeded.  :)  However I find it a visceral distraction.  I think perhaps I'm reacting to an absence of the strong foreground lines elsewhere in the image. So there is an imbalance for me.  For instance if there were clouds that formed receding lines into the distance, a pattern that mimicked the perspective of the vineyard rows, I think the composition would have a lot more power. On the positive side, there is a very paradoxical appearance to the diminishing lines of the rows.  Its almost like an M.C. Escher print where you look at the rows and think they are moving in one direction but then it appears that they are receding in a different direction.  At first I thought you may have cloned some of the rows in because they were so unfathomable, but now I'm not so sure.  ",

  "depth_of_field": "Appropriately deep.  ",
  "color_lighting": "I think the stark silver appearance of the fields paired with the bright blue sky works well.  Yet I feel that there is something missing in the mix.  I appreciate that you have chosen to leave a spot of color and render the rest in grayscale. But I don't sense cohesiveness between the two treatments. I feel as if there needs to be something to transition your disparate elements a bit more gradually. I realize that when you create something of this nature, you're stepping outside the realms of traditional, and 'realistic' imagery, yet I also think you need to be cognizant of how your image is interpreted by the viewers brain.  In this case I think you run the risk of the viewer saying, 'interesting, yet I can see the machinery behind the illusion'.  I'll address this in the improvements suggestions below. I do like the competing shadows and lines in the foreground.  Its just on the border of being chaotic, yet the mind picks through the detail and finds pattern there.  I think the irrigation hoses, often a hodgepodge of curvilinear lines that one has to end up cloning out, also work here.   ",

  "composition": "I like the relative placement of your elements of interest, but I feel as if they are just a bit too spread out.  The leading lines of the grass blade are indeed compelling and elegant but also tend to take the eye into and then immediately out of the image again.  Similarly the nice round soft blue form in the upper left created by soft bokeh effect of a wide aperture is a bit further from the main elements than seems comfortable and as a result also pulls the viewers attention a bit from the grass and butterfly and seems to subtly break up an otherwise cohesive composition. Having said this I will say that the composition is not bad but not as strong as it could be.  I think if the soft blue form was closer to the middle of the composition it would be stronger.  Also I think if the grass and butterfly elements were positioned a bit higher in the frame it would be more balanced.  ",
  "use_of_camera": "I think that for a handheld shot the settings were probably very appropriate.  I think it would have been advantageous, had you the time, to set the shot up on a tripod and use a lower ISO, and thus a slower shutter speed of course, to ensure that there is little or no noise in the smooth gradients of your background.

  "general_impression": "Idan, I like the PoV and the complete story in this image and I feel that the grainy black and white processing style really suits it. It has a photojournalistic style. It doesn't need the distractions of colour. Because you've shot at a relatively high ISO that delivers lower image quality anyway, the black and white conversion lets you capitalise on that grainy appearance. I presume that you've enhanced the grain during post-processing (knowing that higher quality capture at ISO 1600 is well within the capabilities of the equipment you've used).Overall, it's quite a good image. I think it can be better with some finessing.Thanks for choosing me to critique your image, Idan. I hope that I've been helpful. Enjoy your photography andif it moves you, shoot it!Rob Smith AAPS",

  "composition": "You have taken a point of view (PoV) looking down on the artisan and this has helped to limit the chance of unwanted background objects interfering. The PoV also allows the viewer to see that the worker is punching nail holes to make a picture, presumably related to the adult and juvenile giraffe displayed on the computer. This is detailed storytelling.Your camera shoots in a native 3:2 aspect ratio and also allows you to shoot with other crops. This image looks to have been cropped by you in post-production and it raises some questions about why you have made certain choices. I'll discuss those later in the critique.I'm interested in the synergy between the downward gaze of the artisan and that of the adult giraffe on the computer screen. It's as if both are looking at the nail being hit with the mallet. I'm not bothered with the tight cropping of the worker's head. You've kept the most important parts and this tighter view brings the viewer closer to the action.There's strong contrast between some of the light and dark areas of the photograph and I don't feel that they are all working well together.",
  "use_of_camera": "1/50th @ f2.8 & 70mm ISO 1600Almost everything that I see here suggests that you know how to operate the camera, Idan, and the settings you've chosen for this image are appropriate.There's evidence of some over-exposurethe computerand I'll discuss how that could be managed at the time of exposure and in post-processing. It appears that the light level was low and you've chosen ISO 1600 to compensate for that. You've shot with the lens wide open at f2.8 and with a shutter speed of 1/50 that blurs the movement of the hand and mallet. Some might like the movement to be arrested. I would disagree. The motion blur makes the image dynamic and is integral to the story being told. I can imagine the tap tap tap of the mallet striking the nail.",
  "depth_of_field": "Depth of field is good. It's neither shallow or deep and it works well to ensure that each of the elements in the image is rendered appropriately. The subordinate elements are not allowed to compete with the primary onesin a focus sense.",
  "color_lighting": "The available lighting suits the subject and there's no evidence of flash being used. Flash would not have been a good idea. I like the highlight around the edge of the worker's nose. It gives the impression that the worker is being lit by the bright computer screen. The toned conversion to black and white looks good and is appropriate for both the subject matter and an image captured with a high ISO setting. Converting to B&W also means that there are no white balance issues to contend with in post-processing.",
  "focus": "The far background is sufficiently out of focus to not interfere with the subject(s). I think that the plane of focus is good, with the sharpest details being the worker's face, arms and hands. The computer appears softer and that works nicely in the context of your image.",

  "general_impression": "Bibs:Bravo on a beautiful photograph. I personally do enjoy striking runway fashion photographs and I believe you are on the way to having a good eye for everything from composition and exposure to capturing that decisive moment. After many years in the industry I understand that timing on events like this is very important. And I feel you made the correct decision overall to capture the subject at this moment. ",
  "subject_of_photo": "The subject in the center of the frame is a very striking model walking down a runway with new fashion from designer Son Jung Wan. What is important to remember about runway fashion is that it is primarily about the clothing rather than the person who is wearing it. Models are generally very tall and thin in dress size so that the designers can use less materials when creating the initial look for show on the runway. The mood of the photograph also fits very well with the outfit itself. A soft warm glow falls upon her face and the outfit is also carefully lit to show the different pieces. ",
  "composition": "Overall the composition is good. I would be interested to see this same walk sequence and photograph taken about 4 seconds further in time so the model would slightly fill more of the frame. But of course doing so the photographer would have to readjust his level so that the signage in the background would not coming through the subjects head. That being said they did make the right decision at this moment and distance to create a nice spatial distance out from the wall and the camera. ",
  "use_of_camera": "Overall the exposure and speed are good for this image. Given the photographer is working within the confines of using the light only from the stage above for the subject. I do enjoy the slight blur in the bottom half of the subject also. It appears at first to be a technical error but after a second longer examination does convey a sense of fluid motion towards the viewer that I feel enhances the image. This is complimented of course by the solid statuesque gaze we have from the torso on upward with the subject. This careful balance of the two fields creates a more interesting photograph. My own wish is that the exposure overall for this image was bumped up about +1/3 - +2/3 stops to give a slight more push in the subject and contrast.",
  "depth_of_field": "The depth of field is very good in this image. The signage in the background of the frame is still easily readable. But there is still a nice spatial separation occurring with the subject in the center of the frame.",
  "color_lighting": "I really do enjoy the subtle light and color that is occurring here in the photograph. The monochromatic palette of the clothing compliments the similar style lighting and exposure of the scene. You can also just make out the audience on both sides of the runway stage. They are participants on the scene but take a much more subtle role of passive rather than active in comparison to the subject in the center.",
  "focus": "The focus on the subject in the frame appears to be clear for the most part. The issue with a long telephoto lenses are that you will not always get the crisp clarity of a prime lens. But the extended range in distance to zoom in is a good tradeoff for certain situations like a runway show.",

  "general_impression": "Okay Brendan, I'll say that your image has some technical and compositional flaws but somehow I find it pleasing. I find the feeling of it pleasant. It's positive, it's warm. Also, by trying to get the sun shinning through it I can see that you have good ideas and and a good eye for detail and that is very important! You said it yourself that you're new to this so it is completely normal for a beginner like yourself to not execute the image completely right. It will come in time and by chasing your ideas (which are good, judging by your image) and learning some things about composition, light and colour you'll get there very soon! Keep on taking pictures!!!  ",
  "subject_of_photo": "I don't know how this thing is called in English, but it definitely has potential for some interesting solutions, even abstract solutions. You had a great idea to capture the sun shining through it! ",
  "composition": "I don't know but I'll say something I don't say so often; I would like to see this subject in the middle of the frame. It somehow dominates the frame with its multiple colours and circles that it draws the eye from any other potentially interesting element in the frame. In this image there is non but if there were any it would be very interesting to see how it would work like that... That background is a bit uninteresting. This thing that lurks at the top left part of the frame shouldn't be there. It is an obvious compositional mistake. Also, I don't like much this door or window part in the right part of the image. It's also something that makes this image's composition uneven.",
  "use_of_camera": "Elements of this subject (some circles) are heavily overexposed and I don't like that. You lost the colour of those circles that way. Also, the \"sun shining\" idea is good, but I would like to see that sun flares more accentuated!  ",
  "depth_of_field": "I would go for even shallower DOF, but this is also okay.",
  "color_lighting": "Well, by overexposing parts of the subject you lost a potentially nice colours. This way they are washed out by exposure. Those trees are exposed good but I don't think they are something we could find interesting in this image. Nice and pleasant warm late afternoon light is covered by those trees!",

Yumm! I thought you called it quince cheese... We Portuguese call it 'marmelada' (because it's done with the fruit 'marmelo') which is a similar word to marmalade but I guess marmalade for you is a citrous sweet, no?I can tell you in general that this is quite a bit over-exposed looking like it was done in auto-exposure. There is good texture on the paste but you have totally lost texture on the highlights and the knife handle is too blown away and not contributing to the cozy feel we usually get from this food. It actually feels a bit cold and not warm as it should to provide with the proper invitation.The composition also needs to be worked because this is not helping to achieve your goal.Anyway, I  really like the look of the bread and cheese with the paste, can even feel it in my palate.Have you been working on your more creative project?Cheers",

  "general_impression": "Denis, I think your image is very pleasing and has a lot of good, interesting color, detail and form in it.  I think some post processing work on this image, which has been exposed well, could truly bring out the inner beauty that is there already. You may very well prefer the more subtle, muted and mid-tone accentuated nature of the image as a style and that is perfectly well.  My suggestions below are simply that, suggestions as to how to make the image pop a bit more, or provide the viewer with more detail and contrast.  ",
  "subject_of_photo": "Hi Denis, Thank you for sharing your photos with me.  I like the nature of this image.  There is nothing particularly unique about the subject matter as it presents as a straight forward landscape.  However the texture and colors of this composition become the subject here and I think they work very well together.  My first impression of this image is that it looks much like a painting.  ",
  "composition": "I think the thing that works best for this image is the layering of the varying textures and objects.  This 'stacking' of the perspective provides a depth to the image that would be lacking due to the absence of any strong leading lines or forms drawing one's eyes into the image. The large tree anchors the left third of the image nicely.  The two smaller trees on either side also provide a repetitive form that helps balance the image as well.  I think there is just a little bit of extra space on the right margin that could be cropped to some advantage.  ",
  "use_of_camera": "I think your exposure settings worked well.  Perhaps you could have come down a stop to f/8 or so just to reduce the exposure some and increase the overall contrast of the image.  Assuming of course that you left your shutter speed at 1/200th.",
  "depth_of_field": "A good deep depth of field allows for the development of background detail on this image.",
  "color_lighting": "The image is exposed well, but I think for my taste, and considering the colors and detail that are there in the image, it may be a bit too light.  The histogram for the image shows that the exposure does not clip any highlights or shadows, but is heavily stacked to the right suggesting a light exposure with brightened mid-tones and lowered contrast. ",
  "focus": "Looks very sharp, maybe just a little too sharp. It appears that some in-camera, or post process sharpening may have been applied as well. Also there is an appearance of the application of noise reduction to the image which gives it a smooth waxy, but not altogether unattractive, look. Its difficult to tell what has been done post processing wise, on low resolution images that have been reduced for placement on the web.   ",

There's a couple of points that I don't have information on such as your focal length and the f-stop, or whether you were hand holding or using a tripod. Overall I liked this shot.

As I said previously, I'd like to see the rod in focus all the way through to the tip so adjusting the focus and depth of field to achieve this would be my advice. ",

I would have preferred to see the rod in hand to be perfectly focused right through to the tip.

  "general_impression": "Hey Jonathan. You have a great mood going here with your model. I like your rapport with the subject, the relaxed feel of the image and her eye contact with you. It's sometimes difficult to keep all the technical and aesthetic details straight when you're in such a dynamic and agreeable situation, but good portraiture demands that you think with two minds, as it were, directing with a technical and artistic eye while working with the subject in a very humane and engaging way. I've got some suggestions for you that I think may help your thinking when next you've got such a cooperative subject to work with.",
  "subject_of_photo": "You've got a great subject here and a great connection with her, so that's a success.",
  "composition": "The photo would have been improved by choosing to rack your zoom right out to 55mm for this photo. That would have given you a 70mm equivalent which would have improved the perspective on your photo. I'm seeing a bit of foreshortening on the subject's right arm and shoulder which doesn't feel right to me. I'm really troubled by the way you've managed the truck as an element of the photograph though and that cropping of her right arm near the joint is a bit severe.",
  "use_of_camera": "Your exposure seems sound. You've held detail in the subject's dress in its brightest areas. So far so good. I don't like the processing of the image though. If you haven't run this through an image editor, I'd have a look at Canon's Picture Styles settings. I prefer to set these to neutral and then make small adjustments to bring images into line with the way I'd like to see them. The defaults can sometimes process the picture in a way that's not suitable to your subject matter.",
  "depth_of_field": "You're wide open for that lens in this shooting situation, so while I might wish for less focus on the truck using shallower depth of field, that isn't going to happen in this situation.",
  "color_lighting": "Colour is good and the lighting is nice and even. I find the shadows to be blocked up though. It surprises me that I can't see anything in the shadows cast by her hair behind her right ear.",
  "focus": "Your focus seems to be on the eyes, where it belongs, so that's great.",

Should you include more of the tree and less of the sky risking a \"busy\" image or more of the sky and less of the tree risking too much dead space?? In this example I would have composed for more of the tree. The blank sky is dead space to me; particularly so with no clouds or other objects (such as a few more birds). I feel the branches are a bit distracting but not enough to be a detriment. They are at an acceptable focus to demonstrate what they are yet they do not take away from the subject of the photo. The subject is too close to the center of the photo. In my opinion it would be better had you panned more to the left to fill more of the frame with trees. Despite the sky in front of the eagle providing space or breathing room, I feel it is dead space as blank as it is.",

Depending on the degree of softness, sharpness may be recovered in post processing.",

  "general_impression": "Hi David,Great pup facade you have here, this is a gorgeous house. And your photograph is not that bad but the so called HDR effect you have used here is not flattering at all and it's harming the whole result a lot. This is going close to the illustration effect but not with a good result.HDR photography is probably the most difficult to do properly and the use of automated softwares is definitely not the way to go. Anyway, it's good that you're trying to colour tone and work your highlights and shadows to get the most detail possible. This is a good start even though the rating is not brilliant.If you're seriously committed to do good HDR photography, I'll be here to help you out. To start off you can check some of the HDR examples I have in show here in my Gurushots profile. Most of the late afternoon and night photography are HDR.I'm sorry if I disappointed you with harsh words but there is something that you will always know, with me you'll get the whole truth because this is the only way I can really help you. Please give feedback so we can talk further in case you think I was unfair in some way.Will do my best to help!Cheers",

I like that it is balanced and layered in a way that feels solid and stable.  But I think the power and scope of the image is a bit lost by the flat horizontal layers and vertical stacking of them.  You may not have had the opportunity to move around and see what other orientations and perspectives that might have been available, but nonetheless, while it is a good capture, it is not dynamic or particularly powerful.  Specifically I mean there are no foreground objects, to frame or provide a scale or sense of depth to the image. Similarly there are not any leading lines or curves that bring the eye from the foreground to the background in a fluid way. The image presents more like a flat tapestry.  It is beautiful but not particularly powerful.  ",

There is, in the histogram, some shadow and highlight clipping on the far ends of the tonal scale, but this is of no consequence really since the whites and blacks that it effects constitute a very small percentage of the overall tonality of this image.  There is, despite the good overall exposure, a little bit of over brightness to the sky and snow, and some shadows in the treeline that could be brought up a bit to reveal some detail there. ",

  "subject_of_photo": "Wow, this is a fascinating image. I was happily surprised to find such a great shot in my Gurushots account!. Not only did you make a terrific landscape picture, but you also included a great depth of field, a great HDR technique, and the reflections of the water, reflecting this sun at a very exact spot...You're writing about Depth, a sense of space... Here I don't totally agree. To me this picture the subject of this shot is this big strange blue glossy rock in the foreground with the sun exactly on top of his reflection, giving it a mythical power. The rock in the background, and all that space at the left is of much less importance,",
  "composition": "That is why, talking about Compostion, I have problems with this crop. Why did you cut the image this narrow at the right, and why did you leave some much space at the left? Now it seems like the image is falling rightwards, and it's out of balance. Or if this crop is what you want, maybe you could have darkened the left side of the image more, to get more of a balance, and to make the image even more mysterious?",
  "use_of_camera": "F22 HDR automatic bracketing well done. At least, with aperture priority you are always in control of your dof and I like to work that way too. The HDR starting at 1/60 is risky when you don't use a tripod, because the longer bracket can become 1/15, and with the water maybe moving, even using a tripod, this can be a risk. But it worked out greata.Well done.",

You even took that sun, or its reflection into you image. This is very risky, and yes your whites are bleached out (difficult to print) but I like the effect very much giving this image an extra level than 'another HDR landscape\". That effect can work out cheap, but here it works great. You even choose to leave out the sun and use only its reflection, and that is great.The HDR effect in the shadows, especially on the rock look a little purple and that also helps to make this image surreal. The other colors are not too exaggerated and that feels natural.",
  "focus": "Focus we have. F.22 gets all good things out of your lenses, and maybe you used a tripod? At least the focus is ok. And your focus, while this even more important, was even better.

Your subject matter is interesting and engaging to the viewer and there are multiple opportunities to capture behaviors and patterns and different compositions in situations like this. I hope you made a lot of exposures to choose from. This type of situation is also a little difficult because of all the movement, both from the boat and the shifting distances of the birds plus the different speeds individual gulls are flying at. The cloud cover makes for a bit of a dull backdrop, but also reduces the potential issue of high contrast experienced under sunny conditions. Your subject (the gulls) is prominent in the image, so there is little doubt what you are trying to capture here.",
  "composition": "Your composition is good. Your horizon is straight, which is a common issue with photos of moving subjects (while bobbing up and down on a moving surface). I see a tighter composition of the four central gulls (the ones with the dark tops of their wings showing), cropped left of the leftmost gull (you could remove the part of the upper left gull that will be cut in half), just below the upper \"V-shaped\" gull flying toward the camera at the upper left, just to the left of feet of the right hand full-body gull in the middle right, and below the feet of the lower gull with its face obscured by its wings. When shooting this kind of scene, observe the behaviors and patterns, zoom in closer to crop out extraneous bits of the scene, you might see individuals who are acting in a more interesting way and focus on them instead of the entire flock. There are multiple ways to photograph this kind of situation.",
  "use_of_camera": "Depending on your intentions for showing or stopping motion, shutter speed will be your primary driver in these kinds of situations. Selecting shutter priority mode will let you set the shutter speed desired and concentrate on the action without worrying too much about overall exposure.

You could try adding some flash in this kind of situation to bump up the contrast between the birds and background, but be careful that the flash doesn't over darken the background. Use a manual flash setting where you can control the flash output or use the flash exposure compensation setting to reduce or increase the flash output accordingly.",

I suggest you shoot many exposures of the same subject, if possible, while varying your composition, both vertically and horizontally, paying attention to the edges of your frame. The more you shoot, the better and faster you'll compose. Try tilting the camera as well! Sometimes this can be very effective to create strong diagonals. Horses are a common subject, so make them special with your point of view.",

  "composition": "The perspective of this shot is direct and honest, lending itself to the majesty of this stallion. The composition would strengthen by either cropping the image square while having the head remain in the center or, vertical and tight, reducing the amount of body visible and using the hair on the right as lines to draw the eye into the face.Also, by adjusting the exposure/brightness in an editing program, the lower right corner could be darkened to aid in balancing the weight of the image while giving the horses' body more shape.The position of the head creates a beautiful curve on the left of the image. In the future, use lines like that to create strong diagonals within the image, perhaps titling the camera to do so.",
  "use_of_camera": "Exposure is right on, preserving a nice tonal range in the dark face of the horse among the high key background. Contrast could be increased a bit. This will make the image pop a bit more. You were very successful in your capture of a moving horse with a 400mm lens. That is not an easy feat. Choice of shutter speed is good. In the future, if you want no motion visible, increase it even more. Is it necessary? No. Motion works in this context.",
  "depth_of_field": "The shallow depth of field draws attention to the sharper face. ",
  "color_lighting": "Color and light are soft and muted, almost monochromatic. The soft light models the face of the horse very well. A brighter, harder light would not have been as effective, losing detail in shadow.The color also give the viewer an idea of the space surrounding the horse, an open plain, perhaps?",
  "focus": "The area around the mouth is the sharpest, which I imagine was not your intention but, the eye is close. It appears that the horse is in motion, judging by the softness of the body, which creates good depth between body and face.",

  "general_impression": "Hi Mike - this is a very cool shot. While some may not care for the barrel distortion - I think that it works well here artistically because the scene is so big. I thought about suggesting a crop for this image, but Montana is big sky country and the extra blue add the top helps demonstrate the grandeur of the scenery. Like I mentioned before, this shot resonates with me on an emotional side. Even though I have never visited Glacier NP, it's that time of the year in the mountains that strikes a chord with me. It's like they are screaming, \"Open for Business!\" I enjoy this critique and thanks for selecting me!",
  "subject_of_photo": "One can't go wrong with photographing the many beautiful lakes at Glacier National Park. The reflected light on the water is beautiful and the clouds in the sky compliment the scene well.",
  "composition": "Overall, I like your composition. It is expertly balanced. The deep views of the well illuminated peak with splashes of snow remind me of an early summer scene. This view feels \"fresh\" to me and wets my appetite for summer! It resonates with me emotionally. ",
  "use_of_camera": "I don't see any obvious technical issues with this image. Exposure looks about spot on. I love the way you froze the ripples on the water with the 1/250 second shutter speed. There is appropriate shadow detail in the conifers and you held the highlights in clouds pretty good.   ",
  "depth_of_field": "As previously mentioned, your focus - including depth of field - looks great front to back and side to side. ",
  "color_lighting": "My guess is this was probably captured in the morning perhaps an hour or two after sunrise. The light doesn't appear harsh and the highlights on the water are soothing. The clouds look to be breaking up and it was obviously a breezy day. The cool, blue color cast here is very refreshing. ",
  "focus": "Thanks for including the large version. It is extremely helpful. Focus is tack sharp from front to back and side to side. ",

  "general_impression": "You have the right idea in setting up and composing this image, but poor technique causes the eye to be drawn to uninteresting and unsharp areas of the image. Vignetting is a little overdone, and in this case emphasizes the bright, unsharp area.",
  "subject_of_photo": "This type of subject requires a lot of effort by the photographer to make it work!  You have a great deal of similar subject matter in the image, and I'm assuming that you are trying to highlight only the close, bottom left leaves. If not, it's unclear what the subject is.",
  "composition": "You have placed the subject in one of the power points (check e.g wikipedia on the 'rule of thirds' if you are unsure what that means) and the subject IS sharper than the background helping the eye to go there - which is what you want. However the bright spot center, left and upper, is what the eye goes to first and that includes both some of the leaves and the wood, and the latter is out of focus.  The eye will go from light areas to dark, sharp to soft, and high to low contrast. So to make this image work the subject should be lighter, sharper, and higher contrast than the supporting areas of the image.You can do that in camera (always the best way!) or in post.  If you want to see more on this, look at Vincent Versace's videos on YouTube.",
  "use_of_camera": "Use the aperture setting to get the depth of field that you need to isolate your subject (make only the subject sharp).  It seems that you were trying to do that, but haven't quite achieved a good result.",

  "color_lighting": "See above re the bright spot that drags the eye.  The big challenge when the subject is a similar color to the background, is deciding how to make the subject stand out.  If necessary screen the harsh light in areas where light is not desired - or fix in post.",
  "focus": "The image is not as sharp as it needs to be to make the subject stand out from the background.  You have the right idea, and practice leading to better execution will get you there.  Keep at it!",

The flood lights adds a mysterious aspect to the structure with shadows and textures that are fascinating to observe and of course capture on camera. In your shot the tower is the main subject and the flood light in that  area really stands out highlighting the center portion.",
  "composition": "Paul compositionally, the main subject is of balanced tilted to the left and the top of the tower doesn't have enough room to breath. Take a little more time to compose your shot and ensure the camera is steady and level and there is room around your subject matter .The contrast  is lacking, Your  ISO is set to  800  which is good to allow for this exposure, it is the time of evening that has created  the problem of lack of contrast and detail in the trees which also effects the depth of the photograph , lack of separation between the trees and the church.

An f stop of  f 8 or  better would  assist here to improve this problem and of course the time of day would allow that  with the shutter speed. If you happened to be there at  this time of evening  the other  main helper would have been a tripod, this would allowed at f 8  and longer shutter speed  and using the self timer. ",

The texture, color & detail of this photograph makes it different from other close up nature shots. Yes I have made some suggestions on how to improve this shot, but over all, I do like this shot a lot!!",

Auto works well for \"snap shots\" but if you really want to photograph \"art\" it is a good idea to learn what the camera is really doing. Shooting in manual is the best way to do this. Shooting with the aperature at f/5.6 was a good selection here, it blurred the background nicely.",

I do find it just a litle on the \"patchy\" side. A couple of the light patchy areas are on the \"hot\" side. You can easily burn these areas in, on photo shop.",
  "focus": "The focus is not bad but because the subject was in motion I find it slightly on the soft side. The vains and the web of this leaf should just pop out if it was fully in focus. The shutter speed of 1/500 of a second actually did a fairly good job of stopping this leaf in action.",

The loss of one eye, a bit of blood, a ripped up ear; this wallaroo has definitely gone a round or two just as you described.  He is the \"Rocky Balboa of the Wallaroos\"!  Your perspective, composition, depth of field and focus all add to the photograph's story.  My only suggestions are to add brightness, warmth and structure to the wallaroo to have him pop even more in the photo.  Great job!  Thank you for the opportunity to review your photo.  I enjoyed it and the story behind the photo.Kind Regards,Kathleen Reeder",
  "subject_of_photo": "The subject is conveyed in the photo exactly as you noted in your description - the look of an old wallaroo who has gone a round or two.  He's husky and fearless.  The \"Rocky Balboa of the Wallaroos\".  He's a very prominent subject.  With a bit of blood next to his lost eye and with parts of his ear missing, he's been around the block. It's great that he's looking right at you with his one good eye, ready to bop you if necessary. But also that he's comfortable to relax in the meantime.  The only change that would have made this subject even more powerful in the photo is if he was standing with his front legs off the ground.",
  "composition": "You put his face spot on a power point in your composition, that's outstanding.  You are shooting at his eye level, which draws the viewers eye right to his face, again outstanding.  You included just enough of his environment, giving the viewer the sense of where he lives.   You did a great job being careful of what parts of the background were showing around the wallaroo's face.  For example, there are no branches coming out of his head. I would like to see more structure or detail in the wallaroo's coat.  This is easily added in post processing.",
  "use_of_camera": "Acceptable exposure, but possibly a little underexposed.  I think it could be a brighter without blowing out the highlight in the background.  Possibly +.7 Exposure Compensation.  This can easily be corrected in post processing.  Shutter speed was appropriate given he wasn't moving fast, but you wanted to be ready in case he did.",
  "depth_of_field": "Exactly the aperture I would have chosen given the wide lens you were using.  Nice soft background to put the viewer's attention the subject.  The eyes, nose and ears are tack sharp, with the rest of the body in sufficient focus to pull you in.  In post processing, I would add just a little more blur to the trees in the background.",
  "color_lighting": "You got a perfect catch light in his good eye.  Shade was the appropriate white balance to choose.  I would like to see some additional warmth in his fur to bring out the red tones.  I would also like to see his face just slightly brighter.  Again, easily fixed in post processing.",
  "focus": "His nose and eyes are tack sharp.  You picked an aperture that softened the background to put the viewers attention on your subject, great job.  AI Servo was correct, given you wanted to keep his face in sharp focus.",

  "general_impression": "I have mixed feelings about this image.  I love its feel, colors, textures, implied story, and even most of the composition elements.  I just don't think your attempt to capitalize on the 'slippage' in the layers turned out like you envisioned.  Yet I see what you were seeing and applaud you for going with it. I think if you work this image some more, with your vision in mind you may come up with something that is both enigmatic and not overly stated.  ",
  "subject_of_photo": "Hi Maureen,  This is a very interesting composite image.  I like what you have attempted to do with the blending of the two images and so as far as this being an interesting and compelling image I think that it is. I also like that the environment, which appears to be ancient and very rustic, is inhabited by a brightly clad woman with a cell phone apparently taking a picture. Nice ironical touch.  There are a few issues with it however that I think you might agree need to be addressed. ",
  "composition": "As far as the lines of composition of this image go, I think they are very interesting.  The diminishing archways in the image provide a very nice symmetrical portal that leads deep inside the image and lends a mystical and mysterious feel to it.  The lines of the structure themselves are very compelling as well, particularly the pointed arch cutout at the top of the doorway.  Very unique and appealing.  However I don't think that the offsetting of, what readily appears to be the stacking of duplicate layers of the doorway and wall image, works particularly well as presented.  I like that you have experimented with the accidental slippage of the layer with this, and can see the potential here as to what might be possible using this 'look'. But I think the execution here leaves the image with an 'unfocused' and confounding appearance, rather than creating dynamic tension, and/or a mystifying surreal effect.  My first thought here was 'is this image out of focus.  It wasn't that I thought the image was enigmatic and thought provoking, but rather that somehow the underlying layer had slipped out of place. Its tough to fool the eye into seeing something you want it to see if it can instantly recognize the mechanics behind the technique.  I think that by using this technique you have diminished from the simple power of the original structural lines and confounded the viewers eye into missing the elegance of the lines, and being confused by their confluence. I also like the counterpoint to the stark minimalistic power of the structure with the enigmatic figure of the woman.  There are some issues with her placement that I will discuss below.  ",

I think the hues and colors in this image, both of the figure and the structure, work well together. I very much like how you've rendered and enhanced possibly the subtle and rich texture of the walls.  I think the colors of the woman are nice as well, but perhaps just a bit overly saturated for this particular composition.  There are some minor issues with the 'cloning' or 'compositing' of the womans figure into the background which I'll discuss in the improvements section. But this doesn't affect the rating of this section, since it is for color and lighting.     ",
  "focus": "I think the focus is good when you look closely, but the eye, because of the offset stacking technique that creates softer mirrored images of the object edges of the structure,'thinks' that is NOT in focus.   ",
  "description": "1/40 sec, F4, ISO 200, 25 mm.  I liked the arch shapes.  I accidently moved a duplicate layer at 50% opacity and like the double effect.  I selected the arch shapes and applied the effect only there so as not to blur the rest.  Model cloned in.",

You do not mention aperture, shutter, or ISO so I am going off of experience and assuming in reference to the ISO. If you had a tripod, and shot manual, you could have set your ISO to 200 and an aperture at say F16 and leave your shutter open for a short period to still get the lights, still get the reflection and have less noise and a sharper focus.

The black backdrop causes the models dark hair (which is an important part of the image) to pretty much disappear. Also, the highlights (white underwear) have no texture and appear to be blown out. This could be due to the soft focus.",

While soft focus is acceptable in  boudoir shots and some portraits,generally, for a commercial type of shot I would use as sharp a focus as I could muster.

And you are reaching interesting images but this needs more work to stand up as a good result. This one really needs more work on it to become what I believe it can become. But overall I'm really enjoying to follow your evolution.These greys are really not helping and while there are some areas that have a good plastic feel to it in general this is not very appealing. It's really had to work with solarization type of effect, but when you get to make it work it's awesome. Keep doing this and experiment more with the final look.This time you took a big step further and have took some risks with it. I appreciate this a lot even if my rating may now show that. I like the concept and the way your developing this is very interesting and promising! Love the fact that you have started to work with the human body!Cheers",

  "subject_of_photo": "Another study in lines and perspective.  It is, by its sheer complexity, also intriguing and interesting.  ",
  "composition": "I like the composition here.  There are visually three segments of this image comprised of the lower converging diagonal lines formed by the walkway and handrails. Then a strong vertical composition formed by the columns and lastly the horizontal lines of the buildings floors.  I also like the subtle counter play of what appear to be scaffolding ropes hanging vertically from the building. I very much like the effect of the shadows cast by the fence on the left side of the walkway.  Its the break in symmetry that accentuates that symmetry and thus renders it more interesting.  I think without that shadow pattern the bilateral symmetrical line structure would be a bit boring.  ",
  "use_of_camera": "",
  "depth_of_field": "very deep.  Good.  I don't think a shallow depth of field with a soft foreground would have worked as well. This image requires clarity throughout the frame to enhance the feel of symmetry and pattern. ",

It is a bit Kafkaesque in its mood and if you want that look then it is very effective in conveying a somber and industrial look. I am inclined to think the color version may have been a bit more interesting however.  I'll address that thought in the comments section below. I think the lighting is very good and would not necessarily have been advantageous to wait for more slanting source light and ergo more shadow.  The image is already confounding to the senses and additional shadow would have been, I think, too overwhelming.    ",

I don't know where this is but it's very similar to our shorelines here in Portugal. I love it!I had wrote the first 4 sections of this critique before you sent me the original shot out-of-camera, but I'm going to refer to it on the suggestions. I do prefer the original frame in all senses, this photograph totally works with the extra sea to the left and the reflection of the Sun. It's what I was missing on this version. You obviously chose not to keep it because it had no texture on the highlights... yes, the lack of texture in the highlights is usually a problem and you had to make a choice. Well done!My overall general impression is very good as it has been with you and I hope to see you soon!Keep up the good work,Cheers",

Your decision to hone in on and frame up the tee shirt that says it all was very good,journalistic eye. It becomes the statement of your viewpoint. There is an art to going somewhere and defining it differently than the norm, as in New York isn't just about its skyline or GW Bridge shot... it is al lot about the intervention of people and you have portrayed that in your topic. This image would benefit from having a few more like it in a series to support that. You could type copy on it saying Welcome to Gili and your subject would tell us what it's like there. It could become the opener in your series. Well done.  ",

The two look relaxed and casual. The contrast is good holding the high values without burning them out, but I might have preferred a little fill on the first subject's face to pull him out of the dark. I ike the how the background surrounds the two of them.",

  "general_impression": "Hey Nancy, on the terms that you've described, this is a great bit of spontaneous shooting. Almost everything I've quibbled about in my evaluation of your work would probably have ruined the moment you've captured. Perfection in photographic portraiture is nowhere near as important as mood, feel and conveyed emotion. You've captured all that here, so congratulations on that achievement. Try to keep that emphasis on portraits that share emotion with your viewers and you won't go wrong.",
  "subject_of_photo": "Yes, you have done exactly what you set out to do. You've captured a young man with an expression well beyond his years. Great stuff.",
  "composition": "For a grab shot, and I'm imagining that's exactly what this is, since children are notoriously uncooperative once they know you want them to do a particular thing, this is a great image. I might have some issues with the background, but you've defocused those details quite nicely.",
  "use_of_camera": "Excellent use of your equipment. This is a great image from a point and shoot camera and every element of it that was under your control was handled competently.",
  "depth_of_field": "Excellent. Very appropriate use of shallow depth of field to pop your subject off the busy background. I'm surprised to see an Easyshare camera providing you with such shallow depth of focus, and it's entirely appropriate with this subject.",
  "color_lighting": "Good colour, though it feels a little desaturated, but perhaps that's the light you were working with. I'd have liked the light to have struck his face more directly, but the kind of photo that you're after here doesn't allow for such interventions, so good work at handling the situation as you found it.",
  "focus": "Not quite as crisp as I'd have liked it to be. The whole image seems a bit soft overall, but it isn't blurred or distractingly unsharp either. It feels like a shot that needed a few more seconds to snap into focus. You probably didn't have those seconds available to you, but this is a good photo to take multiple captures of, since each shutter press gives you one more chance at getting the focus right.",

  "general_impression": "It's a great image, but you tell about a homeless in a rich city... I see a homeless with dogs looking timid in the camera, but what gets my attention every time I look at your picture, is the background!The cathedral, the white spot in the air, that's where my focus goes. So infact your picture has two subjects, the man and his dogs, but especially the ND, it's sky and the tourist walking around. And I think that's the weaker point of the image.",
  "subject_of_photo": "This is a couragious subject. I mean that homeless of course. Very difficult to picture, already done so often, very difficult to get really close into.",
  "composition": "This is a strong composition! I can see so many lines, in the fences, from the down left corner to theright upper corner. These fences together with ten Notre Dame make this composition very graphic. Perspective is different. The very wide angle curls the corners, which makes the image dynamic but also very full. The perspective, standing above the homeless means looking down on him, getting more focus on that church. Was that done un purpose? Why did you crop his shoe? It attracts a lot of attention now.",
  "use_of_camera": "Love the fact your working on 200 asa. Why put up iso when it's not necessary. But F4 isn't the best for any lens. Try to use at least 5.6 to get the best out of your lens and use only the very center of your glass.",
  "depth_of_field": "Again, focus on the homeless, F4 so my depth of field stops after a few meters. Stills, with a wide angle like this everything is more or less in focus. So was this F4 for a mental choice? Could you have used F8 ? Would that have been better? To get more focus on the homeless, wouldn't it have been better to have used a little longer lens? ",
  "color_lighting": "Your use of black and white is very good. All greys are in there, black is still with detail, white in the sky is not bleached out. Beautiful!",
  "focus": "Wide angles make great focus, and depth of field of cours, even with F4. A crisp image, no romance, just contrast and focus. Done well, but nothing else would have been possible with this lens. What choice do you have with a 20 mm and the subject in the middle.",

Placing the source about a third in from the edge of the frame, and a third down from the top would result in a more balanced composition. Try cropping it in Photoshop.",
  "use_of_camera": "1/25 of a second is about as low as you can go with a hand-held shot and expect to get everything sharp. Although it all looks quite sharp to me, you would have been better using a tripod for a shot like this. Doing so would have allowed you to use an even slower ISO (ISO 640 is quite high for a nature shot and will introduce quite a bit of digital noise which doesn't matter perhaps when seen at the low resolution used for the web but if you want to print it out for exhibition purposes then it can become an issue.",
  "depth_of_field": "With an aperture of f/2.8 the depth of field will be very shallow. Landscape shots usually benefit from a small aperture (larger f number) to maximise the detail throughout. It is particularly important if you want to print something out fairly big which is certainly possible with a file that is 4308 px on the longest side.",

  "general_impression": "Wendy.Hello and thank you for the request for feedback with your feline friend. :) I was just having dinner the other night with some friends and we were talking about photographers in the area and one of my friends mentioned a Pet Photographer they brought their dog to last year. They had a wonderful experience and received some great portraits that really showed the character and personality of their pet. But just like any type of subject that we as photographers choose to capture it takes time and practice to become adept at getting it just right.With Bill-Bo I think you are well on your way to doing so. Felines are great subjects to photograph as they are very patient and will often stay in the same location for long periods of time to photograph from many different angles and exposures. I find the best time to document them is when there is a nice beam of sunlight coming in from a window inside a house. It's like a magnet for them and you can really experiment with your exposure shooting all around them.With your portrait of him here I think you really did capture his personality overall. And I suggest you continue to move forward doing so. Practice makes perfect! ",
  "subject_of_photo": "Any photograph that has a feline inside the frame will always be awarded high points. Pets are great subjects to photograph and you definitely helped show some character with yours here. This is very reminiscent of a safari photograph that someone would take of a wild lion in wilderness of Africa. Your pet could be represented of a distant cousin over here in the states. :)",
  "composition": "The composition and framing of your pet here is good and centered. I enjoy how you thought to capture this angle lower at the same height level as the cat was lying on the grass. It appears you turned slightly to the right of him so his head would turn a bit towards you to show the rest of his body rather than photographing straight at him and hiding his body.",
  "use_of_camera": "Overall this is a static subject and there is not a movement occurring. So you did not have to be concerned with the speed of the photograph. Your exposure overall is good. The sun in the background behind the feline is about 1-1.5 stops to bright. But you could always adjust that in post and bring it back down without losing your mid-tones on the subject. There does appear to be just slight warming light on the nose and side of the subjects face which is refreshing and gives a hint of separation with the entire subject.",
  "depth_of_field": "I assume you wanted the focal point to be your cat in the photograph. But like I stated previously you were just off slightly in the focus on his eyes here. A shallow depth of field that you are using is a good start though.",
  "color_lighting": "The color and lighting for this image is decent but not spectacular. From your description of the wet grass I am guessing this was photographed in the mid-morning before the sun came overhead to warm up the lawn. Usually during this time of the day you will have 2-3 stop difference in the light especially when you have a direct sunlit area in the frame. For this photograph though you were able to minimize it to about 1-1.5 stops which is good. But the light is still a bit flat overall on the subject. The greens in the photograph are very inviting and cool but after that everything begins to just blend together too much and we don't really get a good sense of mood unfortunately. ",
  "focus": "You almost have a nice soft focus on the feline. But it appears your camera had some issues with the thin blades of grass in the foreground and the main subject just behind them. Trying to \"average\" the objects it settled for a area between the grass and the forehead of the kitten. I would have liked to see a different photograph where the focal point was just centered on the eyes of your cat. When I first look at the image that is where my eye will go directly towards. Sometimes it's difficult to capture that special moment with pets but if you can master the slow crawl towards them without spooking them and you are able to capture a few photographs it will always give you room to edit afterward.",

  "general_impression": "I like the main subject, as it is well surrounded by other well blurred objects that frame it nicely.The distractive elements behind the main flowers are a problem to me, and may be it could have been solved by moving to the right the camera in order to cover these elements with the main subject (Hard to know from here, though..) But moving the camera in such small subject would change the entire thing!I think that the cropping I suggested above would improve considerably the general aspect and strength of the image. This, together with some enhancing to the background elements, would add some more of force to the composition. Even when cropping the image would make the main subject too \"centered\", it would be surrounded by a more stable structure behind, so the eyes would move along the whole photo without the tendency of going just to the subject and get bored faster.In resume: you choose well the main subject and background. Just keep trying different aperture values and see what changes in the final photo. And for last, I always try to eliminate all what I can from any photo I take. If something can be eliminated from it without changing the \"spirit\" of what you want to tell, and without loosing very rich elements in the image, just do it! ",
  "subject_of_photo": "The triad of flowers is a nice subject in my opinion, as the triads works usually well for the eyes to stay into the subject and \"rotate\" inside the picture, with less distractions.So, it s a very good subject!The problem I find in this case, is that the main triad (foreground) has some distractions behind (specially the fourth flower that is very bright in the left, and at the bottom of the lowest flower)That creates \"noise\" in the subtle distribution of the main elements.If this subject is interesting or not... Well, I think that almost any subject IS of interest if you place it, together with the rest of the elements of the image (background, lighting, etc)in an interesting way. I think you did well, but the factors I mentioned above (visual noise or distractions) have a lot of strong in this case, which attempt against the strength of the image.   ",
  "composition": "As I mentioned before, the composition based in this triad, together with the well achieved blurred elements at the background, gives you a very good frame to the subject in which the spectators eyes can move relatively comfortably. However, I would have cropped the image, eliminating the UP and RIGHT portions of the image (about a 25% of the image in both of cases),, so you would have the main subject surrounded by a very stable cross (an horizontal blurry pink rhomboid, and in the right upper corner and in the right bottom you would have some wonderful blue zones that contrast very good with the pink of the rest of elements). In this way, the main subject would be surrounded by more harmonic elements in order to make the eyes move around the flowers.",
  "use_of_camera": "The exposure was quite correct, mainly because you wanted to be sure that the main flowers were not overexposed, so they keep they subtle texture and color.However, I think the background is a bit dark (even though it s just a frame for the main subject) and they could have more presence (a very soft selection in Photoshop (about 40 pixels of feather) on the background objects and then applying LEVELS would achieve that naturally)  ",
  "depth_of_field": "I think it s the weakest point in this photograph. I think that F4 is a too opened aperture for having the three flowers in focus (I would have liked to see that, or at least the three entire red crowns sharp)",
  "color_lighting": "The colors combination, of red/pink tones, in contrast with blue ones (background) gives you enough richness in this photograph. And I like it, even though I would have preferred more blue zones at the left part of the image too.However... I think that the lateral/back direction of light is only favorable to the left flower , as it looks great regarding texture and separation of the flower \"crown\" against some shadows (sorry, I don t know how to say it in English) The flower of the right is quite confusing and it has a big portion of shadows (right portion) that I don t like much.The bottom flower is all in shadows, and it s too sided, so it looses a bit of strength.Anyway, with the available light in that moment, I think it was the best you could do!",
  "focus": "I think you chose the point for focusing properly (considering the chosen aperture value, which is a different story!) The speed of 1/500sec gave you a good and sharp focus.",

  "general_impression": "Overall I actually think you have the basics of a decent hiking photo. While there are some technical flaws the conversion to B&W holds pretty well.",
  "subject_of_photo": "Fairly typical hiking scene with nothing jumping out to grab me and bring me in.",
  "composition": "Your composition is a little stagnant. The horizon sits in the middle of the frame which is somewhat bland. Think the rule of thirds. The position of your wife in the lower corner is nice to bring some interest into the shot but even she sits a little close to the edge of the frame. It appears you are standing so try a little lower camera vantage point",
  "use_of_camera": "Here I would ask why you are shooting at iso 800 and then on a landscape shot using f4. Somewhat counter productive. Not sure what those white striations are in the middle of the image. Could be the suns rays but I am leaning towards flare. Using a lens shade or polarizer would probably help.",
  "depth_of_field": "Here I come back to the why f4 question. When you have mountains that are that far away and you are shooting with a fairly wide to normal lens you are going to have most everything in focus. You would need to open your f stop all the way (with your lens you may already be there) and prefocus on your wife. This will give you the best chance to have the background out of focus. The only thing is that I think the hole picture should be nice and sharp. If you are at ISO 800 go to f/8 or 11 and get your maximum depth of field.",
  "color_lighting": "I like the fact that you change this to a B&W, although I do ask why. Is there something that you are trying to hide, or lack of color punch etc. I don't blame you for doing the conversion though. It certainly adds a somber mystical look.  Remember the higher the ISO the more contrasty the image will be. You are starting with early directional light so be careful",

  "composition": "My first thought on this is the image is crooked. It makes it seem as thought the child is running downhill and the lighthouse is falling over. I do not know which cell phone you have (i.e. make and model) nor if the camera feature has guides. If so, try to use them to line up your subject and keep your image straight. If you do not have guides use the side of the camera's view screen to straighten things up. The main subject(s) of the image are centered. If you do not know about \"the rule of thirds\" here is some info about it - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_thirdsI realize that you were eager to \"get that shot\" but I do not think that your daughter was going anywhere in a hurry with those little legs. Take your time, take a deep breath to calm yourself and then compose the shot. If she did go too far out of the frame you could always try to call her back and have her run again. If you had stood back a bit farther you would have been able to capture the top of the lighthouse and there would be more room to pan a bit to the left or right to put things into the thirds. Judging from the photo I would say pan left due to that distracting shadow in the lower right corner.",

Self portraits are usually the hardest type of portrait for a photographer so you need to get a lot of practice in there to get a good result.

  "subject_of_photo": "Portrait photography is my favourite.",
  "composition": "The perspective would work better if shot from a higher angle. It would emphasise your striking eyes more and allow you to raise your face more. The composition would work better if you pivoted the camera more to the right.

It is coming in from behind you (I'm guessing a window) and lights up your hair, burns the back of your arm and your back, whereas your face and your bosom are all in the dark. The result is half the image overexposed and pulling unnecessary focus and half the image underexposed. The desaturation is not something I necessarily disagree with but for it to work you should definitely increase the contrast of your image. Otherwise it looks more like you were aiming for black & white but just didn't make it. This can be confusing and distracting for the viewer.",

Shooting through a plane window is tricky at the best of times and in that regard you did quite well.I'd encourage you to really get to know your camera and all it can do so that you can better translate your vision into photographs.I look forward to seeing more of your photographs in the future.Best regards,Paul",

The lighting is slightly flat due to the use of flash and would benefit from a bit of tweaking in a photo editor.

It's a good tool to use though and worth finding out about to add a little more impact to your shots.",

  "general_impression": "A well seen and well-taken image that conveys real emotion.There are some compositional errors; the subject seems too tightly cropped; the eyes are slightly too low in the frame and the hand is cropped too high above the wrist making it look \"disembodied\".There are also some processing errors, mainly blown highlights and a slightly flat B&W conversion , which distract from the overall look of the image.But an excellent attempt - and a good example of candid photography. ",
  "subject_of_photo": "Hi Sue, thank you very much for asking me to critique your photograph.Candid portraiture is a very popular, but not always easy photographic genre to do well. But, this is a well-seen and well-executed image, and one that expresses a strong emotion in the subject. You demonstrate a good eye and fast reactions, which are needed to capture such a shot, so very well done on that.   ",
  "composition": "I have some reservations about the overall composition, but these are mentioned purely for future reference - as the image itself is very strong. The image is cropped almost square, and very tight to the top of the subject's head. When cropping around a face, it's probably more aesthetically pleasing to either leave \"space\" above the head, or to crop very tightly well into the hair itself. Your crop is neither one nor the other and as such looks like an error, rather than a deliberate crop.An important compositional rule is to leave space for the subject to \"move\" into, in the frame. I feel that slightly more space to the left of the subject's face would have avoided the slightly \"squashed\" look that the current crop presents.Overall, I feel that the tight square crop gives a slightly \"confined\" and \"claustrophobic\" feel to the image. While this fits well with the tension on his face, I would have preferred to see the subject with slightly more \"room to breath\" all around.    ",
  "use_of_camera": "You do not give any details of shutter speed, or the aperture (f-stop) used. I would have liked to have seen these, but there is no evidence of camera shake and the differential focus is excellent (the background is perfectly blurred to separate the face from the background). ",
  "depth_of_field": "Excellent use of depth of field. It is apparent that you have selected a wide aperture to selectively focus on the face and blur the background. More information on the focal length of the lens and the aperture used would have been welcome, but it appears that it is a longer focal length lens and a wide aperture. ",

The overall tone is quite good, but I would have preferred to see slightly more enhanced \"black tones\" to give the image a bit more \"punch\".Also, there are some burnt-out highlights; on the subjects hand and behind his right ear. It may have been possible to have corrected these, depending on the software used (e.g. in Lightroom  or Adobe Camera Raw) and they do distract from the overall look of the image.   ",

In this case, it may be that the glasses are slightly sharper.",

  "composition": "I love the angle of the hat and the dynamic line the diagonal of the rim makes. Also like the way the model is leaning forward very slightly, as if she is coming out the picture towards the viewer. And I like the total absence of clutter in the background. All very very nice!",
  "use_of_camera": "The use of a 50 mm fixed focal length lens was a very good choice especially if used with low-level daylight as it lets you make the most of the light. A fixed focal length lens also has a way of creating an image which engages the viewer more readily than an image made with a zoom lens. ISO of 200 is nice also, just a little bit of grain (digital noise) which adds to the artistic feel of the shot.",

The nose is soft focus and possibly the lips (hard to tell with an on-screen resolution). By using a slightly slower shutter speed you could have got a sharper focus on the whole face. But it's a creative choice really, not a criticism.",

  "focus": "It's hard to say because I think you have given the image a slight blur in Elements to soften it but I think (hope) you have focussed on the eye. I would always use manual focussing for a shot like this and with people shots always, always focus on the eye.",

You did just what I advised the last time (if I remember correctly)...you incorporated more of subject's surroundings thus making this photo work perfectly. Here we have the main subject but we can feel where it lives and what it \"does\". There are also some elements that lead the eye towards it...elements which are not static. Those elements make this work of yours perfectly balanced with stillness and motion, with passing of time and \"guardian of time\"... I guess your image is sort of a oxymoron! :) Good work, Roland!",

We can feel the strength of the main subject but also see some motion elements which also lead the eye towards the main subject! There's nothing better than to incorporate main subject with other parts of the story deeply connected to the main subject! I mean, how great this is; little waves lead the eye towards the boat and the boat leads the towards the island and the church! ",
  "use_of_camera": "As I said in my earlier reviews, you are no newbie. You know how to use your camera. In this case I like how you captured the position of the guy who rows the boat.

  "depth_of_field": "All okay (see Focus section). ",
  "color_lighting": "I really like this sepia-ish tone of your photo. It makes this image romantic and peaceful but with enough liveliness. The thing I don't like much is pretty bland sky (or clouds...fog). I would like to see more definition in the clouds. A few parts of mountain showing here and there through it...It starts greatly at the line where the forest (or mountain) disappears into cloud, but from there toward the top - there's nothing.",
  "focus": "It's confusing. The church is sharp, the boat is sharp but the trees on the island are mostly muddy... It was maybe very windy so the trees were moving fast, so the shutter of 1/80 wasn't enough to freeze the motion completely, but I doubt it since the water is very still...hence confusion...Also the trees on the mountain are very soft...Too aggressive NR?",

  "composition": "The composition is makes great use of the converging perspective lines of the cell block and its diagonal converging lines powerfully draw the eye into the composition.  The orientation is good and straight which is not always easy to get using your eye since there isn't a definite horizon line to refer too, but still important when you have such symmetry of converging lines to an imaginary horizon. I like the balance of light and dark areas here as well. I don't know what the small cubed object is on the floor but regardless of its utility or natural presence, it does distract my eye in what is other wise a very uncluttered grouping of patterns and lines. Also my eye wants to see another door on the lower left portion of the image.  I realize there wasn't one there, but the composition feels a little off balance because of the absence there.  ",
  "use_of_camera": "I think the exposure on this image is very good. I would like to have seen a little less brightness at the end of the corridor both in the ceiling and the skylights. Its not blown out but I think it could be exposed a little less brightly.  Having said this I also realize that using a multi-segmented exposure mode that you don't have a lot of control relative to how the camera metered the scene ultimately, other than a exposure compensation. But I think the metering mode worked well here dispite the hot spots. You don't say whether you were using a tripod or had a VR capable lens, but if not then the shutter speed would be at least 1/20th of a second as opposed to 1/8. Nevertheless your image appears sharp.  ",
  "depth_of_field": "Great",
  "color_lighting": "Great lighting here.  I love how the light varys from nook and cranny and gradually moves from darkness in the foreground to a brighter terminus in the distance.  I think that the end of the corridor near the roof and skylights could come down a little in exposure, but its not critical.  Its just that there is some nice texture in the ceiling there that would add to the overall mood of the image. ",

It appears that you did not use your lens hood, and also that there might be dirt spots on the lens as the lens flares from the sun is evident in your portrait.

  "focus": "When having two subjects instead of the normal one for a portrait, it is worth considering a higher aperture setting like f8-f10 for more detail, especially on their faces. It is also advisable to use evaluative or martial metering for more focal points to get both faces with detail. Your lady seems to have better detail than her partner, but then again I'm working with a reduced resolution image via the web instead of the original image.",

Your image captures an essence of an creature that for the most part we really don't take the time to appreciate.  I particularly like the translucent nature of his spikes and the understated way you used your flash to bring out the detail and uniquely beautiful patterns in his skin.  Thanks for sharing.  :)",

Other than getting underneath and shooting upwards there aren't many ways to shoot a portrait of an Iguana.  What I like about the compositional elements is that they are simply and strong.  It is for the most part a horizontal presentation with two planes of focus; the subject and a soft background.  Simple and sweet. I like the way you've filled the frame with Spike and brought him up close and personal so to speak.  ",

This works well as it lies just about where it should on the upper and right third of the image.  This composition is fairly classic and feels balanced and stable.

The lighting is overall even and soft and the colors for the most part subtle and nuanced, and a bit muted.  The highlight areas of sun are saturated and bright and create a very nice counterpoint to the more muted mood of the rest of the image.  I'm guessing you did a little saturating or dodging of these highlight areas but if you did its done subtly.  I'm not so crazy about the vignetting of the sky.  I am not sure whether you did this post processing or if it was a result of application of a polarizing filter during capture.  But I think if it were less pronounced it would work a bit better.  ",

  "general_impression": "Hi Lynn, This is an interesting shot, with its autumn gold colour, but needs work done in post processing. Don't be afraid to tweak it in iPhoto to get the most out of it. There are very few shots that don't need something done to them afterwards. This has been the case since photographers first started taking shots only nowadays the darkroom is digital. I don't know what tools iPhoto offers but I recommend Adobe Lightroom or Elements for any serious amateur photographer. They are not too expensive either - and Christmas is coming!",
  "subject_of_photo": "The autumn colours reflected in pools of water was a lovely choice for a subject. I also like the way the picture is in two halves, the trees and leaves at the top and the muddy pools at the bottom.",
  "composition": "I like the diagonal running through the middle of the picture and there is a nice balance to the two halves. I also like the perspective from a slightly elevated vantage point plus the use of portrait format which makes the eye scan up and down and is unusual for a shot like this.",
  "use_of_camera": "1/32 sec is quite slow without using a tripod - however it is not impossible if you have steady hands! But with a tripod you could have chosen a smaller aperture so as to get greater depth of field. ISO 100 is nice here because there is so much detail to capture but given that the shadows are long, the light level must have been low and to maximise the light I think ISO 200 or even 400 would have been better.",
  "depth_of_field": "The background is too softly focussed due to the f stop being too small. A pity because that area is very beautiful but there's nothing you can do about that in post processing.",
  "color_lighting": "The colour is great but if you tweak the contrast using Levels or Curves you will add impact to the shot. The orange colour in the water reflection is particularly good but could be enhanced just a bit to make it jump out at you.",
  "focus": "",
  "description": "Wanted to show the contrast of the lighted part of the scene with the shadowed water reflections. I particularly like the strong orange tone in this landscape which contrasts well with the grass and rock pools.",

  "general_impression": "Hi Rint,This is a really nice shot and I think you can improve it still further by using the Levels (or Curves) tool in a post processing programme such as Photoshop or Elements (see comments below on 'How to Improve Your Photo'). Overall though, I love the dazzling quality of the light - spectacular!",

  "composition": "I think the star burst of light would have been better placed a little more towards the centre, perhaps using the Rule of Thirds (you can find it on Google if you are not already acquainted with it). The sun burst is the most important aspect of the composition and while I don't think it should be placed in the central I would like to see it placed more prominently. So it might have been better to have moved around to the left a bit with your camera.",
  "use_of_camera": "I'm sorry but you haven't provided me with any camera data. It's called EXIF and is a file attached to every digital shot you make. Specifically, I needed the shutter speed, ISO number, aperture (f-stop), and focal length plus any other data such as White Balance setting and so on. By including this data with your photo it gives the pro photographer the chance to offer helpful suggestions to improve future shots.",
  "depth_of_field": "It's hard to comment without the EXIF data but basically the smaller the aperture (larger f-stop) the greater the depth-of-field which in turn means that the trees in the background are sharply focussed. With landscape photography in general, the smaller the aperture the better as there is usually a fair amount of depth which you wish to capture in the shot.",
  "color_lighting": "The color is washed out due to being over exposed. As this is an autumn shot I would have liked to have seen stronger saturation in the foliage. Also, you have not got the most out of the star burst effect. With correct exposure the light effect would be more intense. The sky is also washed out. Presumably it is blue but the colour in the sky is also washed out.",

  "general_impression": "Composition could be improved by taking a lower position and shooting up at the subject and well as positioning yourself at an angle to active a 3/4 profile of the swan. Try to avoid placing the subject in the dead center - especially when there is an interesting element (2nd swan) in the background. If you are lucky, take multiple shots in hopes that the two birds will move a very artistic distance apart. You may have stretched the limits of your camera with this low light and contrasting shot - at least while on auto settings.  The blown hightlights on the subject are very detrimental to the overall image as some very essential detail is lost",
  "subject_of_photo": "Swams are always a compelling subject.  They evoke emotions and have very interesting shapes which draw our interest. The second swan in the background offering a profile contrasts with the head - on main subject adding interest. ",
  "composition": "This composition is enhanced by the contrast between the dark water and the white subjects.  To improve the composition you should try to use the \"rule of thirds\" and place the main subject off center. This is not always possible with a moving subject who has unpredictable actions so you may have to set a specific focus area and then crop for better composition afterwards.  It would also have been better if there were more separation between the two swans.  With animals it is very important to take many photos to get the right moment.  I would also consider photographing the main subject at an angle so as to focus on the eyes and to get a little be of profile of the beak.  Positioning yourself lower would put you at the same level of as the swan and would bring the viewer more into the swan's world and add perspective interest. The drips off the beak would also be better featured with a slight turn to profile.",
  "use_of_camera": "If this was shot on an automatic mode, the camera chose settings that preserved details and contrast in the shadows - for example the ripples in the water around the subject, but sacrificed all detail in the lights and hightlights - the body of the swan.  While this very contrasting subject matter required some sacrifice, this was not the right choice.  To have so much of the subject missing - the texture of the feathers, details on the head, separation from the swan in the background, is tragic for the overall image.   Before taking this shot you should take several test shots using several different ISO settings - 1100 may have been too high.  If the camera is using an auto mode you should determine if  you can switch between the modes that effect exposure. They camera may see all of the dark water and mistakenly think this is the most important part. There may be a setting such as \"center weighted\" that will tell the camera \"the important stuff that needs to be  properly exposed is in the center\"  instead of a mode that looks at the entire viewfinder.  Read you manual and you find ways to better control the auto settings.  Also you should move to learning how to set settings manually especially for challenging light conditions such as these.  ",
  "depth_of_field": "I feel this image would benefit if the background swam were slightly blurred. It would focus the audience's attention on the foreground swan while also telling the story of two swans swimming together.  If your camera allows you to use a manual mode to experiment with aperture settings, you should begin to experiment and learn how different apertures can change the depth of field and create and artistic blur to the background and midground subjects.  The overall effect would be to give depth to the image",
  "color_lighting": "The dusk/moonlight is effective on the water and had the swans been properly exposed, I feel the overall color cast would have been correct for the mood  In postprocessing software you might want to warm up the beaks just a touch to make they stand out. Dodging and burning in the eyes is also a nice effect.  I seems that you took this photo while it was still a bit light, but maybe it would have been easier to capture the subjects if it had been a few minutes earlier and more light. ",
  "focus": "It is very difficult to get a crisp photo of a moving subject in low light even with a tripod and it is also difficult to capture wildlife shots with compelling perspective while maneuvering a tripod.  Use the fastest shutter possible for the conditions and also try to use a box, camera bag, or even your knee to steady the shot.  ",

Anyway this is an interesting choice of solution for what probably was a very different thing.I'm not sure what you're aiming for here but it seems to be an investigation into the possibilities of colour limits, and at that you were successful.I'm very curious to see more of your work, since this kind of minimal approach doesn't always speak for itself in one photograph.Looking forward to see more from you!Cheers",

  "subject_of_photo": "I always enjoy the look of fall as it presents in a warm pastoral image.  There exists in all of us, the desire to go back to another time that we perceive as golden, pristine and peaceful.  This very compelling image evokes those sorts of iconic images in us.  ",
  "composition": "There are a good number of interesting elements in this image.  The trees, coiffed green lawn areas, the puffy white clouds on a clear blue sky, classic white fenceline and a solitary country home all work well to create an image of peace and tranquility.  I think overall the composition is good but there are a few stray elements that break up the cohesion and continuity of the image.  First I think the fence rail in the lower right side of the image is a bit distracting and because it is just an unconnected portion of a fence, and not entering the frame and moving into the image, but rather simply entering and exiting immediately, It serves no compositional purpose other than a mild distraction.  More distracting to me however is the portion of the little pond that is only partially visible as it is blocked by the swell green lawn in the foreground. Because there is little detail there in the water, and even less color (mostly white), it presents as a very large empty space, or at least the eye interprets it that way.  I think the placement of your remaining elements is good and pleasing to the eye.  ",

All along the margin between the tree tops and the sky, are various artifacts that make me think this sky was a composite layer placed over the top of the image.  I can't be sure.  But if you look at the image at say, 300 percent, you can see both haloing at the tree tops, and a distinct line of reduced visual clarity of the upper parts of the trees as if they had been, to some degree covered with a white layer. There is also a very murky patch on the far middle to upper right frame that looks like a patch attempt, or some blurring.  However; I think the rest of the image is very beautiful and the colors nicely balanced.  There is a real feeling of fall in this image and it holds together otherwise very nicely.  ",

The subjects are very interesting and the fact that you chose to crop tight so your subjects seem like they're in their natural environment was a great idea. Don't give up. Keep shooting! All it takes is practice.",
  "subject_of_photo": "Welcome back to Guru Shots, Elizabeth.Another good choice for a subject. I can see in the eyes of the gorilla and the tilting of his head that he is thinking of his choice for \"the right piece\". I think if you has asked him to brush his hair to get rid of the distracting element on his head and to get a manicure before the shoot it would be a much stronger photo, wouldn't you??Yes, I am kidding. :D",
  "composition": "Elizabeth, I feel you have put the gorilla too close to the center of the shot. In my opinion the strongest part of this photo is the look on his face... his eyes. They demonstrate to me that he is making a decision (i.e. \"...to select the right piece.\"). The tilting of the head combined with the eyes leads me to think that he is curious about what he is looking at. Maybe that's what you intended to capture. In my opinion it's the expression on the face that makes the photo interesting and it's too close to the center of the frame. It may be a better shot if composed vertically and panned to the left.",
  "use_of_camera": "This may be a better shot with a deeper depth of field. Maybe f8 or f11 to bring the hand and fingers more into focus. 1/200 for your speed helped you to eliminate motion blur and/or camera shake which would have further increased the softness of the image.",

You were fortunate to see the dramatic moment as it unfolded and pretty successful at capturing the brief moment in time.  It does, however, have the potential to be a more powerful image.  The following suggestions may be of assistance to you with this image and future images you may take involving wildlife.",
  "subject_of_photo": "Hello Jeffrey, Its one thing to capture wildlife in repose and another to capture a scene from the day to day drama that occurs in nature.  In this case you have captured a story moment that is compelling and interesting because it lends itself to many interpretations by the viewer as to what is occurring in the frame.  Nice capture here.",
  "composition": "I think that generally speaking the composition here is pretty good.  Their are two focal points here, the eagle and the seagull.  The eagle is pretty much situated in the center of the composition and the gull in the upper right third of the frame.  This balances out well I think.  I'm wondering what the small dark object in the upper right of the composition might be.  It looks like a tiny dolpin, or a small bird flying through the frame.  It is rather enigmatic but also somewhat of a distraction. If it is a dolphin you'd have to explain it to the viewer for them to be sure.  Also I'd have liked to have seen a closer view of the birds as they have a lot of empty space around them and seem small in the frame.  I have mixed feelings about the diagonal foreground of yellow flowers in this image.  The colors work nicely with the blue overall hue of the image and do provide an anchor of sorts for the frame, but the direction of the lines of the section tend to draw the eye away from the action and off the frame to the right.

The image is a bit flat however due to the preponderance of mid tones exposed in this image, this is not a weakness here because all the tonal range you need is there if you have a post processing software program that can make adjustments to your levels or curves.  I'm not sure what sort of program you have access to.  I think the colors in this image are pleasing and the primary yellow and blue tones are simple and uncomplicated.  I think the bright yellow flowers however do somewhat distract from the main subject of this image; specifically the two birds involved in their personal drama. The lighting here is even with few shadows.  I'm going to guess it was close to mid day from the lack of long shadow on the rock angles.  If this is the case this probably accounts for some of the image's relative flatness.  ",
  "focus": "The weak link in this image is the focus. It is very soft and I can't find a point of sharp focus anywhere inside the frame.  I didn't have any camera data to evaluate here, so I'm guessing that the exposure time was perhaps too slow for the movement of the birds.  I see you were using a tripod which would have provided a greater degree of stability for this image, but perhaps with the long lens you were using, wind may have been a factor, or simply a lack of a good focus point from which the camera use to auto-focus upon.

  "general_impression": "Hi Petros,Good to see you back here!Having this title and people in the background 'Marius' is not just a statue on an exhibition any longer, he is a visitor, one with those people going round appreciating the exhibit. That is quite interesting and very narrative! It humanizes us and that is one of the deepest achievements in sculpting people, we get to be interpreted in a way and a relationship builds there, as if the sculpted we would gain life by representing us. This could be an expression of boredom.This also shows that you have a good sense of humor! I already had a laugh here. To call it Aerial Photography it's even more fun, as if this was a giant and you were shooting from an helicopter inside a huge gallery. Or you could be Petros the fly. Hehehehe! Well done! It's fundamental that we keep our sense of humor and you have done it exquisitely. Love this type of brit sarcasm.Sorry for taking so long to write the critique, but I couldn't do it before.See you soon!Cheers",

I used to do a lot of art reproduction and this is certainly a good and creative way to do it, well integrated with it's surroundings, even if it frustrates us because it's very hard.

I just love the sense of joy that comes from this animal, and several things you've done here contribute well to the final image.  Well done!  --Joe",
  "subject_of_photo": "Wildlife and movement are always an engaging combination of photographic subjects, and impressionistic renderings of movement can be interesting, as is the case here.  Even the spots on the animal work well in creating a painterly quality.",
  "composition": "There's a lot to like here, simplicity, two well-defined background areas of color with a strong diagonal, and a pretty interesting moment (more onn that in a bit) on the position of the animal at time of capture.  Really the one compositional question that I have is whether the centering of the subject here is the best choice.  The textbook answer is \"no\", my answer is different.In shooting an image like this quickly, it's inevitable that the subject will be somewhat centered, particularly if you're using autofocus.  I'll often shoot that way and crop to achieve a more energetic composition.But is that desirable here?The usual conventional wisdom would be to crop in from the bottom and the left, leaving the animal more room to move into.  That's a mistake here for a couple reasons, the look of the animal is in part that it's jumping, the motion is upward, and cutting in from the bottom would reduce the sense of space underneath the animal.  And you'd lose a lot of that luxurious green.An alternative approach is to have the animal \"almost leaving\" the frame, a style which often conveys a quirkier mood here, by cutting in from the top and/or right.  I wouldn't cut in from the top (again, the greens).The real question is the right side.The centered composition is (in the textbooks) decried for lack of energy.  But there's no lack of energy here in the image as you've rendered it.  The symmetry is nice, the textures, animal position and blur, all have more than enough gentle but interesting energy to make this image a success.I like the image as it is, and I also like the image as it would be if cropped in from the right into more or less a square.  Both are equally valid images, and they have different moods, it's a matter of what mood you're hoping to convey.One final compositional note:  Love the soft diagonals in the road and in the greenery, too.  ",
  "use_of_camera": "If the numbers here are correct, you made good choices with an intent towards getting some blur from this image, in particular, knowing and uing the extended ISO setting for a longer shutter speed.  As to whether an off-center focus point and composition might have been better, see the discussion there.  White balance looks great.",
  "depth_of_field": "",
  "color_lighting": "The greens and yellows (mustard?) are nicely rendered, as are the browns of the animal, and the overcast light contributes to the painterly look of the resulting image.  This image would not have been as effective in direct light, even if it had been just as dark, the softness of cloudy light works here.",
  "focus": "Obviously there are several causes of intentional unsharpness here, but my eyes do go to the head of the article when looking for sharpness, and the overall bokeh (quality of blur, which here comes from DOF, camera blur, *and* subject blur) is attractive.  Nicely done.",

  "general_impression": "This is the most puzzling image I have seen via GuruShots. I genuinely don't know what to make of it. My gut reaction is that something doesn't quite ring true about it - in the sense that it seems almost too perfect, too \"right\" in the technique. For example; given that you used 1/6th of a second, why is it that the flags are blurred with the wind but the childen are absolutely pin sharp? There is no hair blowing, and their fingers are perfectly still, almost as though they are cut-outs. It's also strange that the grass is sharp and unwavering and yet the flags are blowing around in quite a breeze.Another puzzle is that the flags seem to have varing degrees of blur on them, and some of them seem blurred inside the flag but sharp around the edges. The flag on the far left seems sharp and blurred at one and the same time - and doesn't look \"real\", to my eyes. Another puzzle is that there doesn't seem to be any reflection of light from the monument onto the children - no rim light or backlight - and they seem quite opaque as silhouettes, and even if the shot is genuine with no post-processing, they seem quite lifeless and \"cut-out\".The height between the top of the tallest child and the top of the nearest flag pole is also puzzling.Rather than admiring the image - I have found myself spending a lot of time of trying to work out what is \"wrong\" with it. I would be interested to know what post-processing (PhotoShop) techniques if any were. If none at all, then it's a remarkable capture which leaves me feeling a bit \"cold\" unfortunately - which is the opposite, I suppose, of what was intended.I have to say that while I am not saying for certain that the image was manipulated in any way, I am saying that it does have that sort of unrealistic quality to it, unfortunately, which detracts from any emotional quailty it might otherwise have had, for me.     ",

  "composition": "You might have tried to make more of the low angle by including more of the monument. But you have done well to avoid any perspective distortion - especially converging verticals - and yet include all of the children and the flags and poles.The children are place too centrally, in my view, and are too small in the \"letterbox\" shaped frame. The boy on the right has a flag protruding from his shoulder. Inanimate objects that protrude from human subjects tend to jar, and spoil the ease with which the image is viewed.  ",

You have make me grow used to some incredible pieces of food shot from interesting angles. Not that this is not interesting as well, it is, but this one I would in a more clean way.There are a few things that spring to mind and I will give some suggestions for those. I'm not sure about the effectiveness of the vignetting here, just as I'm not sure about the background and the metal benches. But there are also things I like. I like the repetition and nine makes me think about the reasons you went for this number. Was it random?One thing I really thing here is that this shot should have been made with perfect execution and it wasn't. Even if we take everything as is to be the perfect elements, they are not used to perfection and this shot asks for it. The background stands as a great example for this, it is not straight and aligned with the frame and if it was this would have worked really well.",

This also has nothing to do with Blossfeldt work but even so these artists came to mind... do you know them? If not, there is a good suggestion for you.",

  "general_impression": "Hi Marilyn, I think this is a good keepsake image and for the most part well executed considering the limitations of your camera.  I don't mean to disparage your camera as it has a good reputation for low noise and good image quality under normal conditions, but it doesn't provide you with the sorts of control that a little higher end model might. Below are some ideas you may wish to consider.  ",
  "subject_of_photo": "I think this is a very nice portrait of your dog. I'm assuming its your dog. Animals and pets, like family, deserve a place on your wall and in your memory book as well.  I think as a pet portrait the image works.",
  "composition": "The composition of this image is pretty good. It is a bit centrally oriented but the dogs head fills the frame nicely.  I think it sits a bit low in the frame for a square composition but this can be remedied easily enough. I think a little lower point of view (you the photographer being a little lower) might have added some dynamism to this image.  I also would have liked to have seen a little more of the little guys body for balance and symmetry.  As it is its pretty much all head and a little bit of torso. As with a human portrait its often more compelling to include some shoulders and a bit of arm in the frame. I do like the splash of red in the lower frame from the collar.     ",
  "use_of_camera": "This image lacks contrast and is overall a bit too dark.  A lot of facial detail and separation of subject from background is lost because of the tonal flatness of this image. I would recommend settings to you based upon your settings above, but your camera is an entry level point and shoot that does not allow custom or manual exposure or focus settings. You do have an exposure compensation control feature of +\\- two stops which has the effect of darkening or lightening your exposure.  In this case your automatic exposure feature on your camera looked at this scene and saw a lot of light and bright areas, including the dogs fur.  It took an average of the scene and saw it as bright overall and exposed it to the midtone values which resulted in a rather dark and dull image.  If you had the ability to use a spot or center weighted exposure setting, you could have taken a reading off of a dark or middle gray area of the image and exposed for that resulting in a more contrasted and lighter image I think.  ",
  "depth_of_field": "The camera did a good job of lightly softening up the background and keeping the subject in good focus. It appears that your camera selected the widest aperture and this had the effect of creating a shallower depth of field which works here.  ",

  "general_impression": "What I like about the photo is the focus on the head is good. Colour and texture of the snake skin comes through, so it should be easy for a snake lover to identify. Sadly, I feel that the opportunity to get a fantastic shot of this snake is missed due to, a confusing background and flat light with no shadows or real definition. A better angle and nearer position to the snake would have also helped in providing the impact and detail required in such studies.",
  "subject_of_photo": "Hi Marty! I have not done too much animal photography. Usually it is whilst I am on holiday and in the past I have stalked a few deer for the fun of it! However, some principles do obviously effect all photography and I can perhaps advise with those in mind.What we have here is a reasonable image of a snake. To be perfectly honest, it does not really do much for me in terms of interest. To me the point of taking a shot of an animal is to either show it as a perfect specimen, in its natural surroundings, doing what it is best known for, or doing something cute or unusual. You tell me in your short description that this snake is grumpy and in the full tilt strike position, but personally I do not get that from the picture. Yes it's rearing up a bit, but what happened in the next frame or the one after that? Perhaps this is a dangerous snake and you didn't want to get too close? I would say though that if you want to specialise in animal photography or snakes in particular, then you will have to be dedicated and very patient. It will take more than one shot to capture the beast at its best!So, to sum up. Not a very interesting picture unless you are a snake afficiendo. There has to be more to interest the viewer in a case like this. The snake has to look angry or grumpy! It has to be at the point of striking or in the process so that you see the fangs! How you go about this is another matter of course! Remember patience and dedication and a lesson from Capa, \"If your pictures aren't good enough, you aren't close enough!\"",
  "composition": "Composition is OK, but I would expect you to get in closer and tighter. With a 200 lens you should be able to do that even without a tripod. Snakes head and expression is the main thing in this shot for me. Perspective is OK - on an eye level with the snake. But for me, I would have had my arms outstretched and the camera resting on the ground for stability, aiming up in to the face of the snake. I think a lower perspective looking up and really getting in close (if it had been safe to do so) would have helped. So in this shot with what you have, cropping needs to be tighter to focus in on the head. The rock too is distracting, could you have moved it?",
  "use_of_camera": "All of your camera settings seem to be OK. Exposure is OK, although the light is very flat. Not really much you can do with that, if it was an off the cuff shot with no real opportunity to add additional lighting, such as off camera flash. Only as a suggestion, I would have perhaps started off expecting things to move quickly and the action to happen at speed. Therefore I would have upped the ISO to a minimum of 400 to allow me a bit more leeway in terms of shutter speed to freeze action and smaller aperture to ensure a nice sharp image.",
  "depth_of_field": "Depth of field is ok. The snake's head is in focus and the background out of focus which helps to put the attention on the snake. For me, in this instance with the foreground being a bit distracting, I may have chosen a larger apperture and tried to defocus the foreground as well. More awkward in having a very narrow depth of field of course and controlling the point of focus, but can be worth the effort if you have the time.",
  "color_lighting": "Very flat here. All tonal values are similar with not much separation of subject from background. In some situations, this is what you could have been looking for. For instance, if the snake camouflages itself, then it may have made a great picture if you had trouble spotting the snake in the image. ie. if the viewer really had to work hard at seeing the snake, the point of the image is proven. However, in this case I feel that you were probably more interested in the snake itself and therefore more separation is reuired. Could you have put the snake in a less confusing background perhaps? On a rock? In stronger light with more defined shadows? Something to think about.",
  "focus": "Focus is good as the head appears to be in focus, this being the main subject area. Animal photographs are supposed to be really sharp! So no complaints here. Remember what I said earlier though, that in animal photography, sharp pictures are usually what is required, unless you have a very good reason for not!",

I like everything here but the flash and would perhaps prefer that she would not be looking into the camera, that could be more mysterious ans that is something you don't want to get away from.I run away from the flash when there is enough available light, but that's me, I prefer to go for the most natural look. I'm not saying you shouldn't use flash, but for you to use it you have to be very careful with the shadows it produces, you have to use it creatively and for that you need to take care of the plastic side of it. I do use it but only creative and assume it's use, I usually don't use a flash to fill in light, it almost never gives a good result. But that's me... I'm quite demanding with my results.You're making more and more curious about your work! Can't wait to see what you'll bring up next :)Cheers",

  "general_impression": "Hi Julie, overall I think you did a fantastic job with this image! I really love street scenes such as this. They tell so much about humanity and our daily lives. As I said earlier, this photo has such a timeless feel due to your conversion to BW. It reminds me of an image one of our beloved street photographers of the 1950s may have taken. If you get a chance I recommend that you look up Vivian Maier, http://www.vivianmaier.com. She was a daring young photographer who lived in NYC and Chicago during the 50s who wandered the streets to capture the essence of everyday life in those cities. Your image reminds me of one she may have taken. Keep up the great work!",
  "subject_of_photo": "Your subject is excellent. I can see why you were inspired to take the photograph. They juxtaposition of the people, as you mentioned, create such interest. I also love the sign in the background, Congress Hotel, which sets the place for the scene. (for those who know Chicago anyway)",
  "composition": "You may hear from some people that the main subject should not be placed in the center of the frame. But in this case I disagree with that \"rule\". I feel that you have so much interest on either side of the fountain that placing the fountain in the center of the frame balances the composition. For me, the center of interest is the group of people on the lower right of the frame, though the fountain is your main focal point. The bird on the upper left and the large open space on the left also balance the darks on the large dark area on the right created by the skyscrapers. Lovely composition. I also feel that your perspective is fantastic! I love that fact that you are lower than the rest of the scene when shooting. By shooting at this POV you are elevating the importance and prominence of the people and the others elements in the scene. Your use of lines, vertical and horizontal, keep the viewer's eye moving around within the frame. There is a lot to keep the viewer interested and wanting to explore within the borders of the frame. Cropping vertically adds to the tension of the tall fountain and buildings. Yet the casual and relaxed group of people gathering at the base of the fountain add a wonderful calm contrast to the harshness of the city. ",
  "use_of_camera": "At 1/250 sec you have managed to soften the falling water of the fountain yet the speed was fast enough to freeze the action of the people. Since the people were all moving relatively slowly, if at all, you didn't have to worry too much about motion blur. ",
  "depth_of_field": "Excellent DOF. The background is as important as your foreground here so I'm happy to see that you shot this at f13.",
  "color_lighting": "I appreciate your converting this image to BW. It gives the scene a very timeless feel. Your conversion is good. You have managed to retain a lot of detail in the dark areas of the scene, i.e.. the buildings and the people. I love the shadow of the man sitting on the steps. I would have liked to have seen a little less brightness around the fountain. It appears that you may have done some \"burning\" to the sky and top area of the fountain. With post production techniques you could lighten the area around the people a bit more and de-emphasized the fountain. ",
  "focus": "Your focus appears to be spot on. The important elements are all in good focus. ",
  "description": "The intensity of the water shooting out from this popular Chicago fountain, as well as the people enjoying a sunny summer's day. The couple with the old fashioned baby stroller & the guy sitting on the steps, whom appeared deep in thought,             ",

I love the character of the llama (looks like a tall sheep) and the way the front legs splay out and the obviously affectionate relationship between the woman and her animal which you have captured so well. It would have been great to get a frame of the woman looking directly at her llama to enhance that even more. Her attire is just so well coordinated, shoes hat and skirt and as you say the way the pink on her hat, jumper and bag link her to the animal. The more I look at it the more I marvel at just how great photography is at capturing beautiful moments ..with the help of a great photographer of course!",
  "composition": "It sort of works but I keep feeling that I want to shift the camera position. Of course you may not have had much time to play with the composition, but  my eye gets distracted by the detail that runs along the top of the frame. I have played with the cropping a bit and my personal preference would be to raise the camera position and then lower the camera angle to get more of the pavement and perhaps some of those lovely cobbles in the foreground.If possible then I would have instinctively placed the circular stone motif in the top right hand corner, nestled neatly so that you could see all of it. I would possibly have come round to the left a bit to bring her other foot fully into view and to remove some of the left hand side of the frame. I would also have come right in on them to give that relationship even more intimacy and impact. You may not have had time for that as these moments usually don't last that long! ",

  "general_impression": "Hi Denise, overall I give your photo good marks, and confess that there is little I can offer you on improvement to the shot here. I find capturing animals to not be that easy to do. I admire pet photographers who have the knack for getting pets to do exactly what they want the to do time after time.     Since it would seem that you were able to predict what this one would do and was there to capture the moment says something for you as a Pet photographer.",
  "subject_of_photo": " There are two ways I could grade this photo. Since you indicate that this shot was candid, and that you were trying to capture this dogs personality, I will have to grade that do did an excellent job of that! Sporting dogs like the Lab are never going to stand still long enough for someone to pose them. No indeed, you must shoot them while they are in action. That you did, and did well.",
  "composition": "This is an unusual angle to capture a dog from. I studied the photo for some time, trying to figure out where the animal was, and what the dog might be doing.  Perhaps digging, but it looks as though the dog was coming down a steep embankment, and the soil might have already been disturbed prior to the photo. It looks as though the dog was on the trail of some quarry, judged by the perked up ears, and fixed gaze away from the front paws were.I have to wonder if you were standing near the edge of some body of water, or at the foot of a steep hill. In either case, it is a very interesting angle to capture this sporting dog at work.You used the rule of thirds here, this time placing the subject to the right third of the frame.",
  "use_of_camera": "Again, focus, and framing of the subject all within a split second, earns high marks from me.",
  "depth_of_field": "One can get a little sense of depth of field with the background at the top of the frame. The shot would have been a bit one dimensional without that background.",
  "color_lighting": "I like the splash of green, lush vegetation at the top of the frame, and the lush coat of the Lab.You could tweak this photo some in post processing, perhaps the white balance, or just lighten the photo up a little, but overall the color is good.",

Technically, you have done a great job.  Now you need to bring a little more creativity into the image.  I'd like to see less of the green in the foreground and more of your subject, I'd also like to see you bring some more emotion out of the model - She is on the cusp of giving a great expression, I think with a little more encouragement, she could have really connected with the viewer.  I'd like to see this from a different angle, (perspective to the model - I do like that you are shooting laying flat on the ground towards her.) I'd also like to see a little more contrast in the overall image.  ",
  "subject_of_photo": "Your subject is prominent and interesting.  I like the way she is in focus and the rest of the image is out of focus.  I also like that she is making direct eye contact and feel some intensity from her. ",
  "composition": "I think you are on the right path, but the execution is lacking.  The green bar of blurred grass at the bottom of the image is too prominent and distracts from your subject.  For something like this to work, you need to be able to see some of the jaggedness of the blades of grass come up into your subject while retaining the depth of field - had the grass been longer or different shades of green it wouldn't be such a distraction. ",
  "use_of_camera": "Good choice of equipment, exposure and speed. I can tell you put some thought into how  you wanted your image to turn out. ",

First off the  use of Black and White works well for this image, an old building needs to be in Black and White. You need to make the image of the building from more of an angle, straight on make the image a little boring. Keep trying different angles to create more energy to the image, also shooting either early morning or late afternoon.",

You caught the moment, including all the important elements that \"make\" this shot, and although there's some room for technical improvement, there's nothing wrong with your \"photographic gut feeling\" you just had to take this shot. Good job !",
  "subject_of_photo": "I can understand why you got your phone out to take this picture; the famous peak in the background, the sunny clear sky and a passing skier to give it some depth and perspective. All the elements combine into something extraordinary.",
  "composition": "Composition is good, but images with the horizon plain in the middle are just a bit less exciting to look at than a shot where you either choose the blue sky or the snow in the foreground as the dominating  element. I would have gone for even more blue sky (placing the skier at the bottom of frame), or for more snow (placing the peak of the matterhorn at the top of frame).",
  "use_of_camera": "At first glance, I wouldn't have thought this picture had been taking with a phone, even up close the image could be a closer crop from a rather low-end digital camera. Under the circumstances and using the equipment at your disposal, you got the absolute maximum out of the situation as far as I can tell; well done !",
  "depth_of_field": "Nothing to complain about here; although there's not a lot you can influence on a phone, sharpness is where it should be and extent into the background to show the peak as sharp as the skier in front of it.",
  "color_lighting": "Color looks natural with an even exposure; no bleached out snow and even some detail in the shadows on the skier for example. Personally, I like a bit more contrast; the image looks a bit too \"flat\" to my liking, but that's largely personal taste.",

  "subject_of_photo": "Leonard this is a nice rendition of a wild bird.  I wish I could tell you what bird it is, but I don't know this one. I think the coloration of this image and the size of the bird works very well here. Looks like you caught him in mid chirp which is good.   ",
  "composition": "The composition of this image is pretty flat and horizontal.  As a result it acts as more a documentation sort of image, to demonstrate a species for instance, than an art image.  It is balanced, and cropped well.  It is visually pleasing but not particularly compelling.  But you were using a tripod so you got a pretty good catch with this little bird considering you weren't exactly mobile.  ",
  "use_of_camera": "Good.  Everything is exposed well, evenly lit, no harsh shadows, good depth of field, and nice focal plane drop off in the background. Fast shutter speed ensured sharp focus, and the medium aperture rendered a nice depth of field. I think everything worked well with this combination.  There are, of course, no perfect exposures since each combination of aperture, and exposure times, create a different mood, feel, or feature.  It is argued that there are at least six possible correct exposures (more actually) for every shot.  ",
  "depth_of_field": "Great . . .see the comments regarding DOF in the camera/exposure/speed section.",
  "color_lighting": "I like the colors here.  The cool, gray blue background sets off the warm almost subtly tropical peach yellow and orange tones of the bird.  Looks like the image was a bit color casted towards the blue end of the spectrum (see blue tint to the branch). But this isn't an issue unless it bothers you.  You can adjust this if it is. I like the even, global lighting here.  It has the look of a photo taken on a fairly bright overcast day, or under a canopy of trees to scatter the light.  Anyway, it works well to create an evenly lit saturated image. ",

If there was room against the brick wall further down, It would have been better to move  her against the whole wall same pose etc. but positioning her more to the right  for room in the direction of her head tilt, having the bricks as your background. I hope this makes sense.  Her earing on the right ear could be toned down a little. Great contrast of her face and hair and with the lips dark due to I am guessing lipstick is super excellent !! ",

  "focus": " The overall focus Larry is very good , however the use of  s stop  f 1.8 is to wide, I would suggest the use of say  f 5.6 this would still accomplish the blur of the background  and would bring in some details of the white out area, with of course the adjustment of the shutter speed .",

  "general_impression": "Hi Ryan, photographing straight into the sunlight is something a lot of photographers wouldn't do on a whim, but it really pays off with this shot; you can feel the warmth of the sun just looking at it, and the backlight shows us detail in the flowers we wouldn't see at first glance. Well done !",

  "composition": "One of the first \"rules of photography\" we learn is to keep the sun at our back or at least at an angle; but this image shows that sometimes you just have to ignore those rules, using the sun to backlight the flowers really works here, well done ! The angle makes the overall image more interesting to look at.",
  "use_of_camera": "The manual white balance helps to render a more lifelike image; auto white balance would have tried to filter out most of the yellow sunlight. The fill in flash helps to show more detail in the flowers; you know how to use the different non-standard settings on your camera !",

The flower just below the middle of frame is pretty out of focus and I think it would help the image to have it just a bit sharper. Still, the unsharp background helps to make the flower stand out without totally obscuring the rest of the background.",
  "color_lighting": "I really like the golden sunlight lighting the purple flowers, and the concept of showing the transparency of the petals with the sunlight coming through really worked; good job !",

  "composition": "Your choice of positioning and perspective under the bridge and then, unconventionally, splitting the composition in two is an innovative and fresh way to present your subject matter in an appealing and metaphorical fashion. Not only have you split the view, but you've managed to convey a sense that the bridge divides two separate environments and/or realities as well. You may have heard of the rule of 3rds where the main parts of the composition should fall in the areas of your image where imaginary grid lines converge (two drawn horizontally and two drawn vertically dividing your image equally into 9 separate squares).  Usually it is recommended that you NOT place your main subject square in the middle. This is a general rule that is usually good to follow.  In this case breaking that rule worked out well.

Always try and use a tripod, especially when shooting at that speed, but at that speed you are not just in danger of camera movement but also subject movement.

  "general_impression": "Hi Selena, This is a really striking combination of colors, great eye to spot the pairing of warm and cool colors. That type of color contrast is something I'm always on the lookout for. Many things works really well in this image from the lighting and subject selection, to the depth of field and focus. All of these strong points are hurt significantly by the weak points in the composition. Always keep and eye out for distracting elements, work to avoid them as much as possible, and you'll come away with stronger images.",
  "subject_of_photo": "The pink waterlily clearly stands out as the main subject since it is the only pink flower and there are no other flowers particularly close to it.",
  "composition": "The low angle of view does a nice job of having the viewer look across the surface of the water and see the waterlilies from a profile view. The out of focus waterlily in the foreground is a distraction that blocks the eye from moving into the composition. If there were multiple out of focus waterlilies across the bottom that could have worked as a good base of color, but just a single one becomes a distracting element. The waterlily at the top comes right to the edge of the photo. Leave a little space between the flower and the edge of the image. The concrete/stone in the background has a zig-zag pattern which gives the eye a path to follow in the background. However, the stonework attracts a little to much attention because of its lighter tone. Darken the lightest parts of the stonework to help it fade into the background.",
  "use_of_camera": "Overall exposure looks good. Using a telephoto lens worked well to help with throwing the background of out focus, along with allowing you to zoom in and isolate the grouping of flowers.",
  "depth_of_field": "The shallow depth of field effectively isolates the subject, clearly separating the main subject from the secondary subjects.",
  "color_lighting": "The soft, diffused light is perfect for the subject. There is minimal contrast, allowing for good highlight and shadow detail in the image. The pairing of cool and warm colors works really. The warm pink main subject contrast nicely with the cool purple/blue secondary subjects.",
  "focus": "The focus looks great, it's right where it should be, on the pink waterlily.",

The caption is also interesting suggesting a more conceptual approach to it. Well done! Not sure this is all that different as I has been done a lot but everything has been done a lot and in the big scheme of things it is indeed refreshing to have a submission like yours. This is indeed an interesting portrait.I'm wandering how the result would be if you had done this with no post-production, all in one go with the sketch in your hand like the picture is suggesting.For an iPhone shot under low light conditions this is a great result!Well done!",
  "subject_of_photo": "Awesome idea for a self-portrait and even more because this is not just a self-portrait of you but also of your work, and then there is work on top of it which is also a self-portrait of your skull.

  "general_impression": "Hello again Mary...Welcome to the end of my critique (ha ha).This shot was a good idea from the start. I am really impressed with it. I understand what you wanted to portray and you pulled it off nicely. However, I believe you could have done better. My second-year photo instructor always used to say: \"Take more than you need. You can always get rid of it later if necessary.\" I think you took more than you need and you should edit the photo to make it look even better!",
  "subject_of_photo": "Hi Mary...I can definitely see where this image could convey an idea of faiths. The almost ghost-like appearance of the cross surrounded by clouds and a vibrant blue sky in the background. I think you created a beautiful image with your Cyber-shot.",
  "composition": "In my opinion, this shot would look much better as a vertical. Your subject is too close to the center of the image both horizontally and vertically. If you had panned a bit to the right while shooting this as a vertical, and moved closer with your camera pointed further up, you could have eliminated the distracting man-made elements such as the corrugated fence at left. You would also have gotten rid of the head in the bottom right-hand corner. If none of these suggestions were possible at the time of capture there is always the choice of editing (i.e. post-processing) the shot with image editing software that accompanies many digital cameras.",

  "composition": "Composition is, for me, what lets this image down somewhat. The thing is I'd like to see more... more lake, more land and more sky each of these areas look like they have interesting elements, but I just can't see enough of either to make the shot engaging. Had you stepped back and shot wider you could have included more of this beautiful scene. I also think shooting horizontally instead of vertically would have worked better.",

Your camera has decided that f/5.6 is a suitable aperture for this subject, when in reality f/11 would have achieved a greater depth of field throughout the frame, which is what you want in landscape shots like this.",

It's almost centered, but with the two lines down the middle of the road and then the two lines ,one on either side of the road there to judge how this should have been centered, it's an obvious issue with me and probqably with others,as well. If you put this on a grid and look again, it will be apparent to you and the viewer. I would have inched over towards the left and that would help the overall composition. If the lines weren't there, then this might not be an issue, but any time you create an image and there are lines,guiding lines,be careful when composing the shot. ",

  "general_impression": "Good choice of subject matter but the perspective and lighting let you down. Your motivation may have been aggressive mosquitoes but the result was an image with a lot of potential.",
  "subject_of_photo": "I really enjoy the contrast of industry and nature. In this instance it gives the feel of discovering something that someone abandoned a long time ago hidden in a forest. Like the feeling of an explorer. Interesting subject matter.",
  "composition": "Out of all the aspects I think that this is the part that has let you down the most. The side you have chosen to shoot from shows mostly the flat of the wall. The arch on the side, which is what defines it as a furnace, is nearly completely lost. If you moved more to your right and a bit closer you could have given a more 3 dimensional feel and made it cover more of the frame, giving it a more dynamic stance in the photo. This would make it jump out as something to be noticed rather than something to glance at while running away from mosquitoes. From the elevated angle I'm guessing you're either up a tree or standing on the top side of a slope. Consider a lower angle. You have tall straight thin trees in this forest. These provide a steady vertical linear quality throughout the picture which is easy on the eyes and accentuates the furnace but imagine how intimidating it would look shooting a portrait of the furnace from a low angle so the treetops hang threateningly over the old decrepit man-made relic. You have to decide what you want to show. For example, nature's power over the man-made, or man's creation boldly surviving in nature. Perhaps you want to show a marriage of both so you could go close to the furnace and shoot the bricked arch leading into the forest. Either way at the moment you seem undecided as to your subject matter so your focus is lost. Also, the dark tree on the far right hand side pulls unwanted focus and ruins the flow of the open forest depiction.",
  "use_of_camera": "Given the calm weather conditions your speed is fine and so is the exposure. Maybe a little narrower aperture for contrast would have given the photo a bit more dynamic. Something else to consider; the same photo on a very windy day shot with a slow shutter speed would create a brilliant motion vs. static effect between the trees and the furnace.",
  "depth_of_field": "From the angle you're shooting, f2.8 works to rub out some of the foliage and give a bit more focus on the furnace.",
  "color_lighting": "The colours need a little tweaking perhaps to remove a bit of the overpowering green and introduce a little more red and blue. White balance is a tricky subject especially when your frame is so dominated by one colour. Keep in mind that you don't always have to go for true colours. Your photograph can lend a different mood if the colours are purposefully offset giving for example warmth or a spooky feel. About the lighting, if you happen to revisit this site go for this shot when the sun is up. By afternoon you've lost your light and it's mainly bland and equal over the whole frame. I think the picture would be more powerful with rays of sunlight dancing through the leaves, creating a good contrast of light and shadow to play with, not to mention visible beams.",

With a quite common composition you managed to make the ordinary look special. And that's the most difficult thing in photography.You did a great job doing brackets and combining them to an nice and pleasant landscape EDR picture. Thank you for that. Maybe you could experiment a little more with it?",
  "subject_of_photo": "An interesting photograph of a landscape. Those bumps on the coastline, the colors. A lot to see.At first you think, well easy.But when looking closely there's a lot to discover.You talk about: Landscape V`s Waterscape, Bracketing landscape photography.Is this the perfect landscape picture? Well, I think you come quite close.To me this picture is not about seaweed, landscape or water. I am fascinated by the Layers, Colors and Focus.When I close my eyes a little I see blue and magenta, I see a dream landscape with a hint of 40's kodachromes.",
  "composition": "The way you place that curly coastline in the center of the image, I like a lot.With those bumps of seaweed, making it a lot more interesting than just a quiet beach.These bumps communicate with the trees behind it. A very 'boring' composition, horizontal and subject in the middle.But that's just what gives it it's balance and power.",
  "use_of_camera": "It's a great idea to do a landscape in EDR. (I just heard this term, being Extended Dynamic Range instead of exaggerated HDR)I think you did a great thing while landscape is just 'a landscape', but with your technique and this Perspective you made an ordinary landscape into something special without exaggeration. ",
  "depth_of_field": "When using a tripod in bracketing, you could even have shot this image at F22.Ok, you'd have had extra long exposure times, but you would have used only the best part of your lenses, with a depth of field much larger.I'd like to know what would have been the results than. The water would maybe be moved, out of focused, in those longer opening times of the shutter.Maybe this would bring the picture to another even more mystical level? I don't know, but I'd like to try.",
  "color_lighting": "Through EDR you used the available light to do something specials. Colors are sparkling, density and dynamics are wide.But it all isn't too obvious, it's subtle, and that's just what I like in here.",
  "focus": "You're focus is on these bumps and the water. I mean the lens was focused on a bump, but the visual focus, compository lines and colors are leading in the background, making my focus go to the far end tree in the background.Having two focusing points in one image is tricky. Try to play with that.",

Every little detail seems to be on the perfect spot with the perfect amount of exposure. The curve on her back accentuated by the shadows of the transparent textile she has on her left hand, the right hand holding the other side of the textile of which we can only see a relaxed thumb. The fact that we can't see her face. It's all very nice. I'm also not sure about what seems to be an effect on her skin, for it takes the photography feeling from this and makes it feel more like a sort of hipper realistic drawing or an illustration. Not saying that i don't like it, just that it's not conducive to a great photographic result. The grey tones are very well managed and this almost looks like a solarization without having lost any of the texture to the highlights. The shadows, on the other hand, do have that look and could keep a bit more texture that they have right now.All in all a very good result and I like it as it is! Congrats!Sara",

  "general_impression": "Ignat, I really like the promise of your photograph. I think it's a diamond in the rough. You could have improved it with some greater care with PoV and composition at the point of capture, but there's ample scope for remedial action.Some might look at this image and say \"Mmmm...it's just an average photograph of an ordinary scene spiced up with the blurred tree.\"I think it's more than that. And I think that your decision to photograph the scene as you have done betrays a mature photographic vision, or at least the potential to nurture oneif this image is more accidental than deliberate. It takes a mature eye to look for and find compelling images in the everyday. Most of us can produce competent photographs of awesome and beautiful things that are obvious to everyone. Talented people can produce rabbits out of hatsso to speak: images that make people take notice of the design, beauty (or tension), and symbolism in things that are overlooked by the majority.To me this image embodies a few ideas: the rigidity of the man-made environment Vs the flexibility of the living plant, and its raw power; The value of symmetry and challenging so called rules of photography (never place the subject in the middle of the frame?; the juxtaposition of man made trees (the light stands) and a real tree; the bending of a tree in response to pressure Vs the resistance of the man-made trees; visual manifestation of an invisible force (the wind).I seem to have spent a lot of time looking at, thinking about, and critiquing your image. You might think that I'm on drugs due to some of the comments I'm making. I'm not! (Maybe it's just that I like stormy weather!)But there IS something about this image that really makes me take notice. Your job is to refine it and cut out any elements that weaken it.Thanks for choosing me to critique your image, Ignat. I hope that my comments are helpful, and I wish you success with your photography.If it moves you, shoot it!Kind regards,Rob Smith AAPS ",
  "subject_of_photo": "Ignat, at first glance, this is a subject that many would not see into. Sure, they'd notice the storm clouds, and the blurry tree. They might take a snapshot of it, and that is all. I find the subject matter really appealing, though it's not something that grabs me without looking at it for a while. I think you've made the subject more appealing than it otherwise might be. That's a talent. I'll explain in the summary.Suffice to say that the tree is THE subject, and its strength is drawn from its relationship to other elements in the frame, and ideas that may be interpreted by the viewer.",
  "composition": "The image does not use diagonals nor a strong sense of perspective in luminosity values or tones, from foreground to background, to make an immediate visual impact on the viewer. Instead it simply uses horizontal and vertical lines and their arrangement to make the viewer look. In fact, I think the image starts with a handicap but then rewards the longer view. There's symmetry in the found layout of civic objects and you've set up some visual tension with it by your PoV (point of view). More about that below.I do think that the composition is flawed, however. I'll be frank and say 'careless' and hope that I can justify my comment below.I like the repetition of horizontal and vertical lines.",
  "use_of_camera": "30s @ f5.6 & 35mm ISO 800 and a tripod, I presume!You appear to be comfortable with the operation of your camera, Ignat. I can't fault your exposure and camera craft. The wind was blowing and the static parts of the image seem to be rock solid sharp. You've used a prime lens, so you had to shift position to get the composition you wanted. I think you could have moved closer for an improved outcome. I'll expand below.The slow shutter has produced a wonderful, living blur effect in the tree that contrasts so well with the static built environment.",
  "depth_of_field": "DoF is fine. I have no issues with the OoF foreground. It improves the perception of depth.",
  "color_lighting": "The colour balance seems to be neutral, neither suggesting that it's a warm summer storm or a cold winter one. The cloud greys are the main indicator that the colour balance in the sky is natural. However, I can't tell whether the raking light in the foreground is from a low sun or artifical lights with a significantly different colour temperature to the light in the sky. Having said that, I don't think it's an image that needs to be rendered with technically perfect white balance (if such a thing can be said to exist for a scene illuminated by multiple light sources with different colour temperatures...well, it can't be said, really!). White balance is simply another creative control we have as digital photographers, in my opinion. You could equally choose to render this scene with warm colour or cool colour depending on your vision for the outcome. It's your choice as the artist.",
  "focus": "From the middleground onwards, everything is in sharp focus. The foreground is slightly out of focus (OoF). Not a problem! The foreground doesn't need to be in focus. The detail interest in the image is elsewhere.",

  "general_impression": "hello Viki, overall you did a great job with this portrait. Much of our challenge in portraiture is getting our subjects and ourself comfortable enough to be able to capture honest emotions. The subjects here look very comfortable and I can hear the laughter through your image. Great. I like that you are crouching down to their eye level, very important visually and a great way to work with little people. So you have the major challenge of portraiture, now let's fine tune the technical aspects of the image and we can communicate the emotions you capture in a way that is visual and emotional.",
  "subject_of_photo": "Great subjects, cute children and they look very comfortable in front of your lens, I can feel a connection between you and them.",
  "composition": "The composition and framing of the kids is really close, be mindful of your crops on body parts. Look at the younger boy's legs. Cropping at the joints looks awkward, either lift your camera to cut at the thigh or lower it to cut at the shin. Cutting at the knee, elbow, wrist, neck (the joints) tends to look strange and creates what I call the amputation effect. Cropping at mid-points, thighs etc, lets our mind complete the shape.",
  "use_of_camera": "Camera exposure and speed is fine. With your lens, try making portraits at the 50mm range to give some separation of the subject and background.",
  "depth_of_field": "The image looks a bit flat. Part of it is due to the lighting you used, frontal lighting flattens our facial features, creating some shadows adds depth. Another way to add depth is to pull your subjects about 4-6 feet away from the background. This also helps reduce the ghost shadows I referred to before. And finally if you take advantage of natural light you will be using wider aperture settings which will give you a shallow depth of field and allow for more selective focus. ",
  "color_lighting": "In a two dimensional image we have to add depth with our lighting and the contrast it creates. If possible take the flash off the camera and postion it at a 45 degree angle, doing this will add shadows to the side of their face that will help you avoid the flat feeling. Also, you might want to start exploring a light coming in from a window, it tends to be softer and provides modeling for our subjects. It also helps you avoid the dark ghost shadow behind the children.",

The repeating arches underlying the diagonals of the bridge are a nice counterpoint as well. the textural differences between the grasses, bricks and the smooth gradient sky also contribute to the sense of layer and balance here. There is some distortion caused primarily by the angle of the shot and the use of a wide angle lens.   I'm not sure this can be addressed and is not a huge issue in terms of the 'look and feel'.  Some might find it distracting. Others edgy.  Its a subject call either way. ",

  "general_impression": "Leonard, your subject is an interesting one and your camera settings, focus, aperture and exposure seem adequate for the situation...  I think cropping tighter will give your image more impact as empty space does tend to isolate the subject but sometimes is overused making the image seem static.  If you like to add this much what is called 'negative space', try shifting the subject away from the center even more to make the space appear more like it was the intention to have the subject occupy a minor part of the area.  In this image, the bird merging with the tree and the seeming nonexistent legs makes the subject seem artificial.  shifting camera position so the subject has the dark background all the way around it should help.",
  "subject_of_photo": "Your subject by being so much brighter than the rest of the image pulls the eye immediately to it,and holds the attention. ",
  "composition": "Understanding that your shy subject required a distance to keep it from being frightened away and I see you used a long lens so cropping would be something I would suggest to improve your capture.  The area surrounding the bird being featureless  doesn't give information about the bird's habitat so one might question including so much negative space.  The foreground tree branches lead the eye to the subject and does show the bird's habitat so is needed to some extent but perhaps not as much because it begins to compete with the bird for attention.  One problem I see is that the bird merges with the tree and gives the appearance that it is joined fast to it.  The legs, being barely perceptible further gives the impression that the bird is attached by its tail to the log.",
  "use_of_camera": "It appears in the image posted that there was slight motion during exposure giving the bird edges and feathers slight diffusion.  Mounting the camera on a tripod should correct this.",
  "depth_of_field": "I like your choice of aperture and it's contribution to sharpness as well as isolating your subject from the background.",
  "color_lighting": "Your choice of allowing the background to go black makes the image almost monochrome except the warm color in the beak,.  This is a good choice as color in the surrounding area would compete with the bird for the eye's attention. ",
  "focus": "The focus on the bird seems right on with the aperture you chose giving enough depth of field to keep the whole body in focus yet gives a slight out of focus treatment to the leading lines of the tree, a nice touch.  Most lenses are sharpest when stopped down about two f/stops from full open and it appears that your choice is right about there.",

  "general_impression": "Hi Mike, The overall impression is quite dramatic and visually arresting because of the lighting, and the wedding couple really stand out from the background. However, I'm not sure that the confrontational stance of the bridge and groom is really suitable for a romantic shot! Did the bridge and groom like it?",
  "subject_of_photo": "Hi Mike, Thanks for choosing me to critique your photo. They are a lovely couple and I think they make a great subject for a photo. However, this is a dramatic shot not a romantic one and not what you would normally expect from a wedding shoot. Of course it depends on what the couple asked you to shoot and perhaps it could be viewed as slightly amusing but I think as a stand-alone shot from a wedding you would normally choose a softer, more romantic interaction between the bridge and groom.",
  "composition": "I am not sure why you have chosen a panoramic format for this shot.  I don't feel it works particularly well here especially as the background is mostly dark and lacking detail. In addition, the eye tends to read a photograph by scanning from left to right so normally you would have extra space on the right side, not the left. Having so much space on the left sets up tension within the shot. The tension works well with the confrontational look on the bride's face and her defiant stance but is this really what the bridegroom wants in a bride?",
  "use_of_camera": "Focal length of 18.0 mm is good as you have included a fairly wide view without any distortion. Shutter speed of 1/200 second is fine for a focal length of 18.0 mm as it will freeze any movement. ISO 200 is good too as their should be very little digital noise present. White balance was set to auto but I think you could have set it yourself to give a warmer tone overall.",

My biggest problem with your image is that it is simply not clear enough. It's not that your image is blurry caused by an out-of-focus shot or an unsteady hand, but it appears something has smudged the picture. Possibly a fingerprint or something on the lens of your camera. I'd be interested in viewing your other shots from this photo session and seeing which shots are more clear.  ",

Taking a picture with ISO setting of 3200 will result in a significant loss of quality and resolution in even the most technologically advanced cameras on the market. I wouldn't recommend it for any occasion except in a last resort circumstance or at night. In the future, I suggest you increase your f-stop to maybe 5.6 while reducing your ISO to the lower number equivalent in order to improve overall image quality. I think even a slightly shorter exposure time say 1/400 of second would still render the action of this photo acceptably clear.  ",

  "general_impression": "Hi Diane,I am not sure what to say about your picture. I get the 'ribbon' and other parts of the picture look rather decorative, but it is hardly a photograph - more a painting. And as a painting it even might look nice in a specific interior. But as you have submitted it for a critique as a photograph (and I am not even talking about it being submitted in a Black and White Photography Category), well, I am sorry to say that as a photograph it is rather poor. The amount of filters, frames and effects clearly indicate, that you have just started your photographic journey and the process of changing your picture into something new is attractive and important to you. Experiments are really necessary for a creative process, but then comes the moment, when an experiment should end, and you should step back and become a harsh critic to your own work. An advice from me would be - try to see the beauty of the light and shadows, of the things that make a photograph good, then you might see, that no filter or effect can bring you more satisfaction than a nice simple well composed and really well seen photograph.Good luck on your photographic journey! :)",

  "use_of_camera": "",
  "depth_of_field": "As far as I can see, the depth of field in this picture is pretty wide, as the texture of the wall behind the flowers is clearly seen.  When you take close up pictures of the flowers or other small objects on an fully detailed background it is advisory to have a narrower depth of field (you can do it by opening your aperture), so that the background would not distract you from the main subject.",
  "color_lighting": "Although the colors are a bit over saturated, the overall color pallet of the picture looks balanced - all the shades of pink and red go well with the yellowish dark green and mustardy yellow. As there is no actual visible light in the picture (and as the picture is digitally altered into symmetrical one with the same light source from two sides), it is impossible to comment on lighting.",

  "general_impression": "Sam, you have a great eye for nature and you are not far away from capturing those great desktop wallpaper shots. You have the camera knowledge and the eye for the location. You only need to be more daring and move closer to your subject, practice with slower shutter speeds, adjust your camera level and be there on the right time for the light.",
  "subject_of_photo": "Great subject with plenty of spring colours. ",
  "composition": "Your choice for the angle may not have been the best for the shot. It is very wide and you could have zoomed in for a tighter frame with more details of the vivid colours of spring. I would've avoided the 3 bushes on the very left of the frame and the dark trees on the right and compose with only the ones in the middle and still get the water and the sky. OR, try to change location and shoot from the dark location on the right towards the more interesting trees that are hidden at the back. That way, you could have captured water, trees and sky as well. The way I see it now: a sky shot and not related to \"Springtime River\". To adjust the perspective, tilt the camera down a bit more and balance the spirit level on the tripod, if you have one. The camera seems to be tilted to the left and upwards with the trees on the right out of perspective.There are substantial shadow areas whereas for a spring shot you would have avoided those. I know clouds cast their shadow on the mountain at the far end of the shot but nature photography is all about patience and the right time. You could've waited for the right time where you'd get the sunlight on that mountain. Sometimes it is worth it to come back on another day for the same shot.Your use of a tripod was great but you should utilise its full utilities as in levelling the camera and composition.",
  "use_of_camera": "You have exposed very well for the highlights and mid-tones but not for the shadows. Shadows are not your subject here where you are addressing spring with lots of colours. Again, there could have been that moment where you could wait and capture those shadows under great sunlight. This would have scored a 10 :)Your stitching of the 2 shots was clean but was un-necessary to get it on two shots. One with a close-up would've done the job.Try using a lower ISO (100) with a slower speed and a Neutral Density Filter (ND) on the lens. Use a smaller aperture like f/22 and this will lead you to a longer shutter speed (more time) where you'd get blurred clouds and smoother water surface. This will generate an overall softer effect which is desirable for some tastes. The motion of the clouds and the water will be looked at as a continuous flow. Very pleasant.",
  "depth_of_field": "Good job on the depth of field. I can see all details in the shot.",
  "color_lighting": "Colours are great andI am sure that the more you wait into the spring, the more colours you will get. Nature changes by the day. It maybe worth it to go back again for the same shot and notice the changes, if applicable. My only concern is on the shadow areas. Try to fiddle a bit with the Shadow / Highlight feature in Lightroom and try to bring some detail out from the shadows. It works and you will have a more balanced shot.Also, saturation may be a bit too high for my taste, which needs to be tweaked down a bit, specially on the sky blue.",
  "focus": "You have done great with focus and the depth of field is high enough to see all details from foreground to infinity. Well done.",

Some manual sharpening using dodge and burn techniques can help this - concentrate on the face first and in the mouth first.  The Highpass filter in Photoshop can help by enhancing the edges of important areas.  A sharpen filter with a mask to prevent sharpening the background can help ",

I like the way the tree canopy comes in and curves nicely downwards, directing the view towards the headland and the ocean. I also like the little spit of land that appears in the corner of the lower left frame that provides some stability to the image as well.  I'm not sure how well the branches that move into the landscape behind them work however.  The form is nice but they are lost within the darkness of the landscape detail and at the same time seem to obscure the detail of the form in the background.   ",
  "use_of_camera": "I think the settings were good, but I think since you were doing a timed exposure you are more likely to encounter increased sensor noise from the longer period of exposure.  I think that you might have been better served with a 100 ISO setting and a little wider aperture, perhaps you could have shot it at f/11 or f/8 and still maintained a good depth of field.  Since your foreground branches appear in silhouette your depth of field wasn't as critical here.  However there are some interesting textures and shapes within the branches that might have benefited from some fill flash too.  The soft water effect from the timed exposure works nicely here too and gives a nice soft counterpoint to the rocky cliffs.   ",

It is not a great image and the subject matter is a difficult one due to the repetition across the image. It needs to be sharp, in focus and show lots of detail to have an impact. This might work as an abstract work if cropped closer, but for displaying plant life not so much.

  "focus": "Looking at this image at 100% the focus seems a little soft, but I really like the background blur so I can't fault you too much fore that - if it was because of your aperture. The main focal points of your shot appear to be the branches and not the blossoms/flowers, which I believe are the most aesthetic quality of the plant. I would have liked to see a little more sharpness in the flower in the bottom center of your image. Again, I am assuming the lack of crispness in parts of your picture is from your aperture selection, but also could be motion blur from a breeze.",

You have took me a hundred years back into a time when many things were being done for the first time. This is what I feel here as if this was an old photograph of long exposure. We have the more modern approach of just having the lower part of the bodies but that is perfect to give us a more abstract connection to it hence being able to identify more and even be transported to this climb.Very nice work!Can't wait to see what you'll bring next... :)Cheers",

I don't know but I guess you could get just a little bit of texture out of the RAW file. The right side is a bit low on contrast but I do like it just the way it is, making them both pop. There is is also due to the comparison with the hard flash light that we have in the couples clothing, mainly on the mans trousers.",

I think that if you do you might find that a couple of distractions might be avoided.  If not, the image still stands as a strong and competently done work.   ",
  "subject_of_photo": "Wow Mary, this is a very interesting and compelling image.  I like it on so many levels.  But to simply comment on the subject, I'll say that it is delightfully colorful and engages the mind with its geometric complexity and dynamic tension. Its also such a typically unique big city approach to dealing with parking. . shelf like containers.  ",
  "composition": "Normally I like a little more organic movement, and curvilinear forms. But that is because I primarily shoot in natural settings free from much of mans creation.  In this case however, the overall diagonal lines originating midway up the composition and disappearing at a virtual vanishing point on the uppermost left hand side of the frame, provide a sense of movement and tension and are nicely set off and balanced by the horizontal buildings at the top of the composition, and also by the counter diagonal lines formed by the girder frames of the auto containers.  I think this keeps the visual interest in motion all around the composition and allows it to take in the myriad visual facets without stopping too long on a distraction point. I realize you had no choice but to take this image from the height you did seeing as you shot it from the NY High Line.  But I don't think a lower angle would have near the power that this composition already has.  I know you said that you like the bottom left area where there is a hint of a street or passage way, but of all the composition I think this is the one I like least. . simply because, for me, it creates a little bit of a vacuum in that corner, almost like a tear in a pattern. My mind wants to fill it in with at least one corresponding diagonal from lower left to mid right.  This is not a big issue but more of a little distraction for me.  Some might even find the gap a welcome break from the over arching pattern of lines in the image.  To this end it is, ultimately, a taste call.  ",
  "use_of_camera": "Its tough to take umbrage with settings when the image has turned out as well as it has.  I didn't see the original image to see whether there were any noise issues or artifacting, or exposure issues that might have been introduced by a higher ISO, but it doesn't look like that was an issue here. Looking at the focal length of your lens, 18mm, you had a lot of latitude to shoot much slower than 1/250th of a second, perhaps as slow as 1/30th of a second handheld. I say this because then you could well have used a lower ISO of 100 to ensure smooth gradations, less noise and artifacts.  ",
  "depth_of_field": "Good.  Deep",
  "color_lighting": "I think the color and lighting works perfectly here.  I sense that you have used a little bit of tone mapping or faux HDR to pump the saturation and contrast and also equalize the various tonal areas. I think this is a perfect type of image on which to use that technique. It is overall a very, urban and industrialized setting, and the colors are sort of an antithesis of the otherwise gritty feeling of the image.  This too creates a subtle dynamism and power that benefits the mood of the image.  I also think that the lighting is global enough to not result in distracting shadows that a later afternoon or evening shot may have created.  ",

  "composition": "It's a bit messy. There are a lot of information here and there is nothing that leads the eye towards something. If there were a less boats here it would be better. For instance if the front boat was here together with the one with blue sails and the one a bit farther to the right, then we would have some kind of diagonal line towards the centre of the village. But, like this it's just boats all around.",
  "use_of_camera": "Your exposure is pretty balanced. There some \"hot\" spots here and there (whites on boats) but nothing stands out as a sort of a mistake. Sky is lovely blue, not too much, clouds are just enough white, trees are pleasingly green. ",
  "depth_of_field": "In the image like this DOF should be infinite and you didn't do it by choosing f/5!!!",
  "color_lighting": "I suppose it was a midday which is not the best time to take GOOD images. As I said all is well balanced nut all is a bit boring when we talk about artistic value of this image. It's a nice informative midday picture of Noss Mayo but nothing else. I'll give you 8 because the colours are nicely captured. ",
  "focus": "Well, I don't know if it's because of the low res nature of this sample or not centre of the frame seems perfect but towards the right and left side of the frame there seems to be some kind of softness. It seems like a lens softness. That is not strange because EF 17-40L tends to be soft at the corners especially with aperture almost opened to the end (it is f/4, right..). That's why I sold mine! ;)",

  "general_impression": "Hello again Sylvain. This isn't an easy shot to execute even when the lighting etc is all perfect with lots of areas of shadow along with slightly over exposed windows and the arch. This shot would benefit from being taken again using an HDR process. You can find exact details of how to do this online, but the basics are, take 3 shots, one under exposed, one at a normal exposure and one over exposed then merge in HDR software to get colours and details from shadow and highlight areas. Give it a go.Regards.Ken",
  "subject_of_photo": "This is a pleasant subject and is particularly hard to get right. Often the internals of buildings are not particularly well lit for photographic purposes. You have done well to get so much detail here altho the brightly lit arch is a little distracting. Images of this nature often benefit from HDR processing.",
  "composition": "Composition is fine here altho as I mentioned earlier the brightness of the arch is distracting. I was also a little confused as to where the light was coming from as the front of the pillars are not lit, but the front of the balustrades, are.",
  "use_of_camera": "Please also consider my comments on depth of field along with this section as the two are directly linked. You must always use a tripod or rest when taking long exposure shots. You have used a rather high ISO of 800 which only adds distortion to your shot. You could have used a much longer exposure time, reduced the ISO and increased the depth of field to achieve a much better result.",
  "depth_of_field": "Using a very shallow depth of field has given you the option of more light in the shot at the expense of detail. Using an f22, ISO 100 and a much longer shutter speed on a tripod support would have given you much better results.",
  "color_lighting": "Colours are pleasant and as you have used a long exposure, you have achieved enough light in the shot.",

  "general_impression": "Hi GarethMy general impression is positive! It's fun and this shot may become a classic in the family annuls. I like that you use B&W. I like that you and your son are involved in photography together. This shot represents that bond. ",
  "subject_of_photo": "It's an excellent and time-honored subject...your son following in your footsteps. He wants to be connected to you, and photography is something you two can share together. The interest and pleasure derived from creating art with a mechanical device is probably a DNA thing. I have shot many good photographs of my daughter, even to the point of her being sick & tired of my wanting yet another shot of her. Now that she's grown, she's got a good camera as part of her essentials. My first impression is that it's a great subject and nice that it's black & white. ",
  "composition": "I do think the image needs some editing to improve the composition. I'd crop about the top third of your son's forehead out, crop a bit of the dark space off the right side of the image (possibly into the right edge of the lens front element) and rotate the image clockwise to make the vertical bookcase in the background straight. I'd also crop a slight bit of the left side out, just enough to make the strap (?) not a distraction. Sounds a bit over controlled, but when I do that to your image, it has better balance and hasn't lost anything important. The front of the lens should be lightened just enough that it isn't without detail, as it appears on my screen at least. The dark detail-less part at the front of the lens leaves me wanting to at least be able to discern something...just a bit of lens detail. It can be off-black, just not blocked up (clipped). I do appreciate that you are tuned in to tight shooting, getting only what's needed to make a strong portrait. I'm very keen on good cropping before the shutter is released when possible. I try not to be a big rule follower, but after my cropping, your son's eye lands real close to the \"rule of thirds\" point, which works well (in the spot where the top third and the left third intersect). It's a tight, balanced composition. Countering what I just offered, as a parent of this boy, you may find that his hair being in the picture is important to you. He has a cute cowlick. ",
  "use_of_camera": "I spoke earlier on good tight cropping. The exposure is fine except for the clipped blacks, mostly in the right area as earlier mentioned. Fine tuning: Just a touch lightening of your son's eye helps strengthen the image. I'd probably try a very slight darkening of the forehead in the upper right area of the image, lighten the front of the lens a tad, darken the hands in the lower left area of the image very slightly.",
  "depth_of_field": "I don't see what f stop was used, but looking closely it appears to be a midrange f stop. It's all right, but there could be stronger emphasis if you shot wide open with your prime lens, which it indicates you used. ",
  "color_lighting": "For me, B&W is king for portraits unless there is a good reason for color.  I like the strong light coming from the right with sufficient secondary light source (fill card, wall, other window, whatever) coming from the left. It helps the composition & eye movement from right to left.",
  "focus": "Nice how the lens leads to the eye, which is focused on you. It would be even better if the eye was tack sharp, more so than anything else. It's not bad the way it is, it's good. ",

Yes it's a good profile of a koala and if I was an artist I would use it to work from, but I'd draw an image with something going on. Here's the thing about asking photography to the level of Art. Photography was born in the age of a science revolution and people were amazed by the \"real ness\" of the new device. But 100 years later real ness is no longer unique. You can find thousands of portraits of every animal. And yes I shoot them just for fun and \"have\" them in my library. But for sharing and printing purposes there has to be a story in the image. When you get tens of thousands of images on your hard drive you start to slow down and edit Before you pull the trigger. Ask what am I going to do with this image. What is the story I'm trying to convey?  And lately I find myself saying yes this a good view but not a good shot if the image doesn't adequatly convey the feeling. ",

The koala is a fun animal to shoot but this image will lead me to discuss some aspects of photography which from your skill set I think you might find some benefit if you have not already considered them.

Your artwork that just making a portrait is not enough. You want the image to make a comment too.  Here the viewer is left wondering, where is the animal?

  "general_impression": "Hi Krzysztof - thanks for choosing me to evaluate your picture. I am glad that you did because this is unique subject matter that I greatly enjoy providing constructive feedback about. These types of images are generally more difficult to critique, at least for composition, because it is hard to tell what lies immediately outside the frame and your options for capture at different angles are extremely limited. I also think editing shots like this can be challenging because of all the fine details and generally these scenes can handle lots of contrast adjustments. It also appears that you employed some type of blur to the scene to soften some of the gritty details like the pavement and cracks in the wall and if so I think this was a brilliant move.  ",
  "subject_of_photo": "I love subjects like this! I have a few similarly themed shots in my portfolio, although I have found they don't sell very well and do not have as wide of an appeal as more traditional cityscape shots. Nevertheless, I find this image creative and the subject very appealing.",
  "composition": "What I like about your composition is the placement of objects in the overall frame. You included just the right amount of sidewalk, the top of the frame where the roof lining starts is perfect and your sides are fairly \"clean\" as well. You did an excellent job of placing the black metal object where it doesn't disrupt any of the major elements with the graffiti on the right and the door in the middle of the frame. Speaking of the black object, I have mixed feelings on it. I find it somewhat distracting and eye catching although it does help provide depth. Ideally, I wish it wasn't as tall. The only other constructive feedback I have for you is I would have preferred (if possible) a little bit more \"breathing room\" on the right side of the frame as the end of the \"e\" in the graffiti feels a little tight. ",
  "use_of_camera": "Overall, you did a fine job. The 100 ISO speed is the best you can use and your exposure is just about perfect. I can tell this because there isn't any apparent noise in the darkest part of the image (the metal pole) and the highlights in the upper left corners are not clipped. Excellent work. The one area where I believe you could improve is using the F/5.6 aperture setting. I think a setting of F/8 or F/10 would have given you a little bit better depth of field. ",
  "depth_of_field": "As previously mentioned, I believe this is the one area of your image that can definitely be improved. Don't get me wrong, I like what you've accomplished here, I just believe with a smaller aperture setting you could have squeezed a little more clarity in some fine details of the image. Most noticeably the grill or vent on the lower left side and the top of the metal pole.",
  "color_lighting": "I like the light and the color. My hunch is this was taken in the morning and captured just before the scene was flooded in harsh, direct sunlight. The your presentation is noticeably warm, which for the most part I think works well. The blue sticker or whatever it is provides some much needed color balance to the scene.",
  "focus": "You uploaded a nice, high resolution image for viewing. Thanks! The corners look a little soft, but no big deal. The door is definitely the clearest part of your image. Overall, very good work!",

Though colour plays an important role here I'd like to see this in black & white, I believe it would give an impressive result. But to me it as impressive as I can imagine is not easy. Anyway, it really works with colour, the only really think that is not sitting well with me is the shadows, they over brightened. That gives the impression of little contrast when in fact there is good contrast here.I specially love the level of detail and rendering of light in the broken branches. It's quite beautiful!Can't wait to see more from this walk to the mountain!Cheers",

  "subject_of_photo": "Another beautiful image.  It does not have the same dramatic power of your first two but is quite an appealing and interesting image in its own right. The appeal here is not in the subject matter itself, but in the mood and energy all the elements evoke.",
  "composition": "Great dynamic motion here.  I think the sky, shot as it was with a wide angle lens, takes on a very dramatic sense of motion. The clouds form a great line of sight into the horizon almost like bilateral perspective lines into a vanishing point.  This alone creates energy.  This combined with the pier line coming in obliquely from the right side of the frame and terminating at the juncture of the clouds where they meet the horizon, enhances the feeling of motion and depth. The stolid foreground rock is a great reference for scale as well as an anchor for the composition.  Its shape also seems to point to the vanishing point in the horizon",

  "general_impression": "Hi Jill, you had clearly picked a very nice place to go for a walk! I get the feeling of a very strong sun shining through the branches, with the soft sound of the wind rustling the leaves and the lake. In that sense there is a real story to this location. There is also a hint of autumn with the red leaves on the ground. There are a few technical points that I would like to draw your attention to in the next few paragraphs for you to be able to tell your story even better.",
  "subject_of_photo": "I really like the forest and the water so combining them in 1 picture really makes the subject great. That you used the sun to light the leaves from the back adds an extra dimension. There is a lot going on though in the picture and some of the items seem a little too prominent.",
  "composition": "The photo feels a little bit cramped from a composition perspective. You have the branches (or sky) and the lower part split 50/50 in this shot. That makes it unclear where the focus lies. Since I think you were really interested to show us the leaves consider in your next trip to go lower and get more of the sky/leaves in your picture. If you go lower in your standpoint you could have also left a thin strip of sky to act as a nice edge between the leaves on the lake.",
  "use_of_camera": "The shot is properly exposed. This is a very complicated thing to get right when you get the Sun shining straight into your lens. I am not sure what F-stop you used for this shot, but it often gives a very nice effect if you raise the F-stop up to the diffraction limit of your camera (probably in the order of F16). The sunlight will then create a nice 'star' shape because of the small opening (try looking through a small hole in a cardboard at a bright light). To use this F-stop you might have had to use a tripod in order to compensate for camera movements due to the longer exposure.",
  "depth_of_field": "",
  "color_lighting": "I think with the lower F-stop previously mentioned you could have reduced the glare from the sun. Also, when you use a polarizing filter you reduce the reflection of the sun in the lake, making the blue colour of the lake stand out more against the green.",
  "focus": "As mentioned during the perspective I think you could lie the focus of the shot more on the leaves. The bottom edge of the lake for example is very distracting, I think the shot would have been more powerful if you had tried to get rid of this by for example using a much wider lens and getting much lower and closer to the lake.",

  "general_impression": "Hi Rebecca!  Birds are probably the most difficult subjects I've ever photographed, or at least tied with polar bears.  They are small, quick-moving, and usually far away.  Difficulties with getting great focus on them are commonplace even for experienced wildlife photographers.  But keep at it, and don't be afraid to take a large number of shots and throw out most of them, one of my mentors liked to call his waste basket one of his most important photographic editing tools!While I've spent a lot of time on some problems with the photograph, some of the issues, particularly darkness, are an easy thing to learn to improve on. What's harder for most photographers to learn is clean composition, framing, keeping distracting objects out of the way, and you've done a great job at this--you're a lot closer to better images than someone who has no eye for photography but who has mastered all the technical minutae.  Keep at it!Also, kudos to you for your patience waiting for this robin.  Wildlife photography can require enormous patience, and your willingness to most likely freeze yourself to capture this sign of winter demonstrates you have that patience clearly.  Do take care to avoid frostbite! ",
  "subject_of_photo": "Birds are challenging subjects, but engaging ones. The choice of subject is good here, and I particularly like the idea of snow on the branches as well.",
  "composition": "The composition works here nicely  In particular, the head of the bird is well-separated from the branches that would be far more distracting otherwise, and the main branch has a nice diagonal from the bottom-right.  While some of the value of this is lost due to the darkness of this image (see below), that none of the branches pass in front of the bird helps too.Also, you've framed the image well. It's easy in images like this to leave in just a little piece of a branch poking in from the side, that can be very distracting, and you've avoided that nicely here.",
  "use_of_camera": "I don't believe any of the blur here comes from \"camera shake\", so I suspect the shutter speed and so forth were okay.There's another issue--this image is very dark, making it hard to make out any details in the bird, and making it hard to visually separate the bird from the tree.  Usually you'll want the brightest parts of an image on the web to come close to the white of, well, this page, and the darks to reach the color of this text.  You might be able to improve this in post-processing, using software such as that that probably comes with your camera, Photoshop, Lightroom, etc.I don't know what shooting mode you were using, but if you use automatic, aperture priority or shutter priority you may find that you can make images like this lighter by increasing your exposure compensation setting.  Often, when shooting light things like snow or cloudy skies, it's necessary to use some exposure compensation (+1 or even more) to get clean, bright whites.  It may seem \"backwards\" to use exposure compensation to \"make light things even lighter\", but that's not the right way to think about it.  The camera doesn't know, when it looks at a subject, whether it's a dark object in a lot of light, or a light object in not as much light.  So it tries to make every photograph look kinda average in terms of brightness.  A scene that is particularly light or dark colored sometimes needs, as a result, positive or negative exposure compensation to get the right look.  There's some ability to fix this after the fact using image processing software like Photoshop, but it's helpful to get the image \"close to right\" in the camera first in any case.",
  "depth_of_field": "A narrower aperture might (bigger f-number) might have helped create a greater depth of field, and increased the chance of good focus on the bird's head, but there's nothing wrong with a narrow depth of field here per se.  This narrower depth-of-field would have worked fine if the focus had landed on the bird head, as the slightly out-of-focus tree limbs would have helped draw the eye to the sharper bird.   ",
  "color_lighting": "Except for the image being too dark, which is a big issue, the colors are good, there is a sense of a grey, winter day here, and the hues feel right, neither too blue nor too yellow, and have the sort of quiet low-saturation look of a cloudy day.   ",
  "focus": "Unfortunately, the main subject of the image, the bird, is not really in focus here.  While some of the fir branches are okay being blurred, the head and beak of the bird are the viewer's window to connecting with the animal, and the beak (which we can see more clearly than the eyes) is not in focus.  Autofocus on birds is difficult, usually the depth-of-field on telephoto shots is razor-thin, and the camera isn't smart enough to know whether it should be focusing on the bird or some part or another of the tree.  Here it looks like it might have focused on some branches just in back of the bird. Sometimes repeated attempts to photograph the bird may produce some in-focus shots, but in this sort of situation I might have to rely on manual focus or to keep a close eye on the feedback my own camera provides on which part of the image it has decided to focus on--unfortunately, few cameras have that sort of good feedback.It can be very hard to tell precisely where focus is when shooting images like this.  Birds are very difficult photographic subjects.",

Anyhow, I still think this shadow is a bit strong and not consistent with the light work from the right, the shirt should be more in the shadow there.

One might be to darken the background and get some rim lighting on the edge of the face from behind, or more light on the blue side of the face.

I have no idea what time of the day or under what conditions this image was captured, but apparently you got it right.

Also the background curtains are much less distinct (=distracting) than in the previous image (Preparing for Flight) and actually blend nicely with the bird's colors.

I find the straight on positioning makes the image flat and lifeless.Im also not keen on the fact that everything is cut off legs, feet, guitar, head but then on the left of the frame there is just blank space had the cutting off of the subject happened on all four edges of the frame I think you could have got away with it but as it is it just looks odd.",

I'm guessing you did a bit of a horizontal duplication of the original image (or portion thereof) from the repeating patterns I can see in the image.  I like that you did not simply rely upon a horizontal 'flip' for your symmetry but apparently (from what I can see) have done some additional cloning and patching to reduce the look of stark symmetry.  I do think there are a couple of areas where the patching isn't quite as convincing and thus appears to include partial segments of tree trunks that are not quite convincingly synched with the rest of the image in terms of direction and integration into the whole.  But overall the vertical lines of the tree trunks, over-layed by subtle horizontal bands of repeating colors create a very nice energy and flow. ",

  "composition": "I would suggest you go lower. This way you will get front subject which leads the eye into the shot and it adds more \"drama\" to the shot. The bushes around the creek are a bit distracting, but I think it would not be that much of a problem at the evening and with long exposure. Especially if you go lower and make those stones main subjects. In this shot the front subject should be those stones and if possible, you should be in the water with your tripod! Try using a wider lenses! Something like 17mm. Going low with wide angle lenses means more drama! ;)",
  "use_of_camera": "Let's say that you did not shot this pic at noon. You shot it at twilight. You stopped down your exposure to something like f 18. What did you get? You got a long exposure and much greater DOF (depth of field). Now, let's get back to the \"amount of water\" part. If your creek had more water than in your shot, you would have had a lot of water foam. Especially around the stones. That water foam combined with the long exposure makes a dreamy and soft effect of water passage around those sharply focused stones and it is much more dramatic and interesting than this straight forward shot. Of course, the use of a tripod is an absolute imperative!!!",

Looking at your f stop (exposure), you should increase the f-stop number. You shot has f 2.8 and it means that something must be a bit out of focus. I suppose you focused on those stones. So I suppose that a far plan of your shot is a bit soft. Try something like f 16 or f 18. This way you get much deeper depth of field and in a shot like this it is a must.

  "general_impression": "Joseph, while I like the idea of the image, I feel there are too many problems with the focus and composition for this to be a quality commercial image.  While soft focus can be a very useful tool, I don't feel it works for you in this image.  Some people can become dizzy, irritated and even experience pain when viewing a blurry image.  Take for example the semi-popular tee-shirts with the out of focus wording on them.  I know many older people who cannot look at those shirts.  A blurry photo is much the same in that some people won't struggle to view the image if it isn't clear.  Many people become over excited when they look through the viewfinder.  So much so that they don't \"See the forest for the trees\".  See the image through the viewfinder and notice the detail and the issues of an image.  Avoid or minimize the issues before capturing the image and then remove the problems that you couldn't avoid in the computer.When it comes to your description of the image, let the image speak for itself.  Your description describes her as being \"she is anxious but energized with excitement within\" which sounds great.  I could visualize her gaze as being described as curious, inquisitive or interested in events unfolding but I just don't see \"excitement\" in the image.",
  "subject_of_photo": "I like the idea of the image.  It piqued my interest when I first saw the image.  I thought perhaps it was a posed image with a model.",
  "composition": "I like the idea and the placement of the model is good overall.  The subject's head being turned creates an action in the image.  The lens length works well on this image.  The problem with the image comes from the bright wall behind the subject and to the left side of the image.  This is a huge distraction and it divides the image and draws the viewer's eye away from the subject.   In a commercial image you must drive the viewer to the subject.  The advertiser is paying to have the viewer's attention on the product or subject.",
  "use_of_camera": "The subject appears to be slightly under exposed in the image.  Using a slow shutter speed (your EXIF data is missing on this image) is sometimes required to capture an image.  In this case it would appear to be the cause of the camera movement which resulted in this image being blurry and out of focus.  Without the EXIF data it is difficult if not impossible to guess what ISO, Shutter speed and F-stop were being used.  It is also difficult to correctly identify what focal length and F-stop the lens was.  I feel I was handicapped by the maker choosing not to include the EXIF data.",

It even gets hard to  see what I can suggest, but there is always something to say and this one is so nice and inspiring that I won't take my eyes from it for a wile. Well done!! You're making me sing!We all experienced photographers know that we don't need a special camera to do a great photograph and you have just proven that to everyone here in Gurushots. This is top notch in many regards and it's a shame that you didn't have your DSLR with you to make this with the best possible quality.Thanks for coming to me with this amazing shot, seriously, it's a delight to comment on such good results! I'm not giving you a full 10 for two reasons, and that is a slight issue on the rendering off the shadows, which are very good but not perfect.Will be keeping my eye on you for the future, whenever you need it will be a pleasure to help!Cheers",

  "use_of_camera": "It's a shame that you didn't have a better camera with you but this is just as valid and you did it great. Being a P&S I don't even know if the manual functions there are really manual or if they are just faking a manual mode. This is a P&S and you did great with it. Not giving you 10 here is not due to that but to the fact that we have some issues on the shadows and a slight problem with the representation of contrast between the shadows and the highlights. I will address this in the suggestions.",

The only room for improvement I see is if you made the subject larger so there wasn't as much empty space in the top portion of the frame. The position and body language of the insect is also helpful in telling a story and conveying meaning. Excellent job! ",

  "color_lighting": "If we were to separate this category into two - I'd give you an 8 for lighting and a 6 for color. The lighting looks excellent. My guess is your capture occurred during a sunny day, but you certainly tamed the light. The flower petals are properly exposed and not at all clipped. And while there is a bit of glare on the bee's wings - it is perfectly natural and not distracting. The color I believe is the area that needs the most improvement. Your description is very helpful and I am glad that you took the time to include it. On first glance, what I see is an overwhelmingly green color cast. I don't mind it so much in the background, but it is very noticeable in the yellow of the flowers and my preference is for more color separation. ",
  "focus": "The eyes of the bee are tack sharp. You focused on the right aspects of the scene and properly executed this capture.",

I think however that there was some post processing issues that need to be addressed before this is something you'd wish to present as a web image or a print.  I think there are quite a few things about this image that make it pleasing and worthy of a print but here's a few things you might want to consider. Overall I would have rated this higher except for the ghosting clone remnants that I see in the image. (If this isn't what has happened here, please let me know via the message system here)",
  "subject_of_photo": "This butterfly, like your first one presents nicely upon first glance.  It fills the frame nicely and there is no difficulty in determining what the subject of this photo is.  Again, this sort of natural photography is always pleasing and butterfly images have a unique appeal because of their inherent design like patterns and symmetry. ",
  "composition": "I think this image is a very nice composition.  It feels balanced and all the lines flow well.  There is little in the way of leading lines to provide depth here nor many curves or diagonals to draw ones eye, but its not so important here considering how the subject fills the frame.  Also the DOF provides some depth to the image.  I like the cropping here as well.  There is empty space but it is balanced well and has sufficient detail in it to give the image a fullness and equilibrium. ",
  "use_of_camera": "I think the exposure on this image is good. I have no idea what your background aperture requirements were, but it appears that your flash synced up well with no dark areas in the image, and a good, evenly lit foreground with a minimum of hotspots.",
  "depth_of_field": "Good.  ",
  "color_lighting": "I think the lighting on this image, and the colors, work really well.  I think the green in the butterfly wings is matched up well with the other greens in the background and foliage. The slight tinge of color of the flowers is a very nice counterpoint in this image. It looks to me though as if you have done some cloning of the background and inadvertently caught in your clone field, random edges of the butterfly wings in your results.  (See if you notice the repeating ghost patterns of the lower wing edge just underneath the butterfly and in the blurred area of the background.) This is my best analysis as to how these artifacts occurred.  ",

  "focus": "On close impression focus looks a little soft. This is perhaps due to the fact that you mention that you have used a soft focus, and presumably you mean a filter as opposed to post-production. Personally, I would have like to have seen the closed eye-lid and eye-lashes razor sharp, perhaps with a retained softness to the rest of the image. For me the over all softness gives an impression of slight mis-focus. This said, perhaps you were on a slow shutter (looking at the rotation of the fan, I am presuming you were) and you mention you used no tripod, so perhaps what I am detecting is very slight blur as a result of camera shake.",

  "general_impression": "Greetings teegee,Your photo is original, unique, expressive, and impressive.  I don't know if you can tell that I like it a lot.  For a thinking person, still life is a great mode of expression.  If you continue, studying and practicing still life, keep in mind: \"Photography is easy; unless we do it right!\"",
  "subject_of_photo": "I think the genre of this image is still life.  There are three main directions in still life: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanitas (vanitas)http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Still_life (symbolic)http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trompe-l'il (showing off the mastery of the artist)To me, this image is about the semiotics of still life; it is about the painting of the painting, and the representation of the representation.  The most famous grandaddy of such images is: http://www.magritte.be/fondation/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/3.jpg by http://www.magritte.be/It is a most interesting subject, especially to people in the daily habit of thinking and not automatically confusing the pointer with the pointed.",
  "composition": "This image is a Trompe-l'il still life with elements of the symbolic.  There are five components in this (rather unusual) still life:the landscape backgroundthe easelthe bushthe transparent framethe hatFrom the point of view of compositional balance, the pictorial space is tilting heavily to the left; both the patch of woods and the hat on the left have no counterbalance on the right.  An easy fix would be to flip the landscape, so that the patch of woods is on the right, which besides giving balance to the image, would also put something more interesting behind the transparent frame.The easel is a bit of an overpowering presence and it imposes itself as the center of attention.  Perhaps, a selective desaturation of its color might improve the situation.  Also, cloning out the labels should make the easel less imposing.The brush on top of the easel is a nice touch, however its color is competing with the color of the sky.  Perhaps a selective desaturation of its color might also improve the image.The transparent frame should be the center of attention (not the easel), but its very transparency makes that hard to achieve.  Perhaps, some extra selective saturation and vibrancy of only the pixels within the frame might help.  Alternatively, reducing the vibrancy and saturation of everything outside the transparent frame should work.As far as the placement of the transparent frame in the overall image, I think that changing the camera position a bit, would make the right border of the transparent frame parallel to the right border of the overall image, and that would provide less distraction to the viewing eye.  Alternatively, perspective correction in Photoshop or even selective lens correction in Lightroom, might help.The hat is a good symbolic presence in the image, and the fact that it's underexposed might even work to add a bit of mystery to the overall image.I believe that this image could be strengthened by using a square format rather than the landscape format.",
  "use_of_camera": "",
  "depth_of_field": "Due to the presence of the transparent frame in this image, the DOF that serves the subject is hard to achieve.  Using a tripod and taking two captures, as described above, should help the situation.",
  "color_lighting": "The choice of color over B&W is good for this image, based on the subject it depicts.  The light is not intrusive and serves the subject well.",
  "focus": "Everything is equally in focus and that misses a great expressive possibility offered by the photographic language.  An easy fix would be to apply a bit of a de-focusing blur outside the transparent frame.  The way it is now, what is blurred is inside the transparent frame.  I would fix that by using a tripod, making a capture without the transparent frame, with focus at the hyper-focal distance, and then taking a second exposure with the transparent frame.  Having these two captures will go a long way in manipulating the final image in post-processing.",

Maybe your photo would work in some scientific debates about life of spider or whatever this insect is...maybe, but as a fine art photo or nature photo it just doesn't. I know it is a tricky subject and it needs a lot of thinking about how to approach it and how to emphasise it if one wants to make an interesting image, so please read my suggestions and see if you can do it again but with them in mind!  ",

Your eyes are seeing something, and you must be able to relate the story to others, that is the secret to photography, and is also the greatest challenge.   Your photo gave me a feeling of foreboding,almost as if it were one of those dark haunted castles on the rocks above.

Upon further review, I decided NO, the lighthouse was not the intended subject. The reason it is not the subject is that you would not have cropped the building off, and if it were the subject it would play a more dominant role in the scene. So then the question becomes, what is the subject? Since in the description you mentioned the texture of the water, I will assume that your subject was the water. Actually you have several feature elements in this scene that could have served you as your subject. Examples are the lighthouse, the mossy/grass covered rocks below the lighthouse,those beautiful rocks in the foreground, and the water itself.",
  "composition": "This is an interesting composition! There are so many feature elements in this shot that one could focus on. Those elements can work for you or against you. The scene from my eyes tell me that you need to have taken several photos, each one telling the many stories that are begging to be told. First you have that lighthouse atop the hill. The lighthouse alone could make an interesting photo. Of course there is the water, and how about those rocks in the foreground, such an interesting assortment of detail in them. What seems to be your subject in this shot, the water, it looks like the fog is just forming just above the water line. I know that you used a long exposure to achieve the effect, and I will discuss that idea further a little later.You used good rules for your composition;however, sometimes you need not become too rigid with the rules. Yes, it is true that one should use the lowest ISO, and the widest aperture to capture a breath taking scene. Your ISO was too low  for the late day overcast sky. If I had taken the shot, I would not have gone below ISO 200, and more likely I would have shot this at ISO 400 or above. The reason,is you must give first consideration to the available light. An overcast sky can allow you to gather details that would otherwise get blown out on a sunny day. However, when you shoot at say ISO 100 late in the day and it is overcast, at that ISO your camera can not react to the dim light well enough to yield too much detail.Way back when,back in the day, Kodak Film Packages were labeled at first with ASA values, which later became the more universally known ISO. ASA/ISO referred to the films sensitivity to light. The lower numbers were for bright sunny days, ISO 100, ISO 200. For shade, and overcast conditions; ASA/ISO 400. ISO 200 was twice as sensitive to light as ISO 100, ISO 400 was twice as sensitive to light as ISO 400, and so forth. That is a good way to relate to ISO on your digital camera, as it is dialing in the sensitivity to light as it relates to the camera sensor.I do like the perspective your photo was taken, that angle works well with that lighthouse, especially so if it were at night and the light was shining, and in the center of the photo, or placed in the upper left with the beam of light shining off to the right out into the night.      ",
  "use_of_camera": "your use of the long shutter speed to add drama in the water flow was good, I like the idea, I just wish that you had tried this at a higher ISO, as too much detail is lost in the scene at ISO 100. I give you props for trying this.",
  "depth_of_field": "I love the depth of field, especially as it relates to the water, and rocks at the lower right side of the frame. The two rocks appear to be protruding out of a thick fog bank, and makes the scene look lonely and foreboding. ",
  "color_lighting": "Color on an overcast sky, at ISO 100 in the late evening? Forget it, not going to happen. Use a higher ISO, if you are not sure, take several exposures, and do not be afraid to change the ISO with each shot. As soon as you think you have nailed it, shoot a series of three shots but bracket, this way you will find a sweet spot for your photo. There is little color detail in your exposure, you could have just as easily made the photo a b/w which could have been interesting, but at a higher ISO to bring out more detail. In both cases you have to have enough light to bring out the detail.I am not sure why you had a flash to fire, as at the distance from this scene the light would have fallen off past the point of lighting this scene. I suspect it fired because the camera wanted more light to make the exposure, in which case, should be a cue to you to use a higher ISO.",
  "focus": "I normally use my focus point to be on the center of my subject, in the case of this shot it appears that the actual focus point could either be on the rock in the foreground, and perhaps the lighthouse. It is an interesting concept, selective focus points, and many cameras today allow for selective focus points.",

  "general_impression": "Hi Martin - I must compliment you on your early attempt at HDR photography and avoiding overcooking the process, which is often the case on the outset of HDR photography.  However, there is a slightly surreal feel to the image mainly because you would expect the foreground to be darker as you are shooting directly into the sun. You have chosen a very popular subject which is enhanced by an interesting foreground. There are a few areas where I believe the composition and capture could be improved which I have detailed below. Overall I believe you have captured an interesting image well, in what are sometimes difficult circumstances to control. Thank you for sharing with us.",

  "use_of_camera": "You have not given me any details on the HDR process so I will assume the basic principles. I mentioned above the surreal feel to the image because you shot directly into the sun the foreground seems a little light. The other issue you have is that the sun has totally burnt out and albeit sometimes unavoidable, in your image it draws the viewers eye and it becomes very difficult to break away and enjoy the other elements of your photograph. Fortunately this could be avoided so next time you have a go at a sunset try out my suggestion below in \"How to Improve your Photo\".The remainder of you camera settings seem fine and well chosen.",

Rules are meant to be broken but in general placing your main subject off-center, creates a more interesting photo.

Shooting this from a lower angle allows the viewer to see a more interesting composition.",

  "general_impression": "Joshua,  I see from your information that this image was captured in an area that had flooded and the log is actually a branch which had fallen into the water during that storm.  This is an interesting story line that is not reflected clearly in the image.  Nonetheless the image is technically pretty good, although lacking, I think, in interest factor.  Here's a few ideas for you to consider. ",
  "subject_of_photo": "Joshua.  Images in the woods and forests or surrounded by lots of foliage and branches are some of the most difficult to take. I think that the biggest issue I'd take with your subject is that is not particularly clear.  The floating log is at the center of your image, but does not distinguish itself well in the frame and so is sort of subsumed by its surroundings. As a result it is not as interesting as it might be under different settings.  ",
  "composition": "The composition is ok, but it is not as interesting as it could be.  The horizontal orientation of the log, doesn't take one into the frame very well and rather tends to flatten the dimension of the image overall.  I like the foreground foliage as it does provide a framework from which to see some depth in the image. Because you are shooting through a complexity of branches and foliage, there are a lot of confusing lines and forms that I think distract from the composition and compete for attention with the log.  ",
  "use_of_camera": "",
  "depth_of_field": "I like the DOF here as it focuses mid range on the log and leaves the foreground in soft relief.  This  softness provides another bit of information that the viewer will normally interpret as 'depth'.  ",
  "color_lighting": "I think black and white works okay here, but I wonder if color might have given you more separation of the elements in this case.  Since the image presents rather flat and shallow, the subtle hue differences in the scene might have provided a greater sense of depth and sensory information to the viewer.  The lighting is overall good, with little or no harsh shadows (which would have really confused the eye considering the complexity of pattern and elements in this image).  There is some specular highlighting and blowouts on the foreground leaves but I think here it works well to distinguish the foreground a bit, and provide a sense of brightness and sparkle that would otherwise be lost. ",

  "subject_of_photo": "This is a little difficult for me to rate as a subject as I don't honestly know how rare they are. I love big cats and from my experience they are shy, nocturnal creatures, so to see one in the open in daylights is pretty special...",
  "composition": "Again, perhaps a little unfair to judge as I was not there. However: Don't forget that all important rule of thirds and trying to find a new perspective. When I started wildlife photography I always wanted to use the biggest lens and get the closest portrait shot of all my subjects. Later on I found that what I refer to as \"Animal scapes\" worked so much better and was so much more believable to the viewer. So it is nice to frame the shot a little wider, have the head of you subject on a 1/3rd line and have their backs perfectly horizontal, unless you can see the mountain curve in the background. If this was me taking the shot I also would have tried to get lower to the ground.  I do like the way you left a space in the direction the cat is facing. That leads the viewers eye in the right direction.",
  "use_of_camera": "Same as what I said under focus. There is obviously no camera shake, which means that you had a fast enough shutter speed for your focal length. I assume you are using a Sigma 50 - 500 and that F4 is your widest aperture?",
  "depth_of_field": "F2.8 would have made a huge difference. Gear limitation rather than execution issue.",
  "color_lighting": "If you shot this in RAW, then try changing the white balance to daylight, or 5600K. To me it looks like it was shot in \"cloudy\" WB and it comes out with too much yellow and red. If you shot it in Jpeg, try \"auto levels\" in PS and just see what happens. MOre often than not that makes it look really nice.",
  "focus": "Why not 10/10? Probably a limitation of your lens rather than a technique issue here. The most important thing in wildlife photography is to make sure the actual eye of your subject is pin sharp. Especially important with long nose animals! That you have achieved perfectly here! The foreground is slightly out of focus which I like, but it would have been nice if the background had more bokeh to separate the subject from it. ",

  "general_impression": "Whatever my critique of the image is - it is one I would have been delighted to have taken myself.  The subject, the lighting and the composition all combine to produce a photograph which has the look and feel of a painting or photographic art-work.",
  "subject_of_photo": "First impressions of this photograph is that it does remind me very much of a faery tale scene - I say faery instead of fairy - because the light has that \"Other-world\" feel to it - and the viewer has to wonder what is just out of sight, around the bend in the gravel road.  The brooding sky and the trees with branches which could also be slowly moving tentacles all give this image a magical feel to it.  ",
  "composition": "In my view, brilliant.  Both the composition and perspective.  The road, line of trees, hedge and wall all lead the eye down to the end of the lane where it turns the corner - and the brain then picks up the journey and wonders just what is hiding round the bend.  A great number of images rely on luck in being in the right place at the right time - but this photographer used their skill to compose the photograph once they found the right place and time.",
  "use_of_camera": "As noted above, it looks fine on screen using a low quality digital image - but I would like to see a high quality image to comment fully.  If I had taken this, I hope that I would have been able to use a smaller aperture - but I'm not sure of the actual light available, so this is not a serious fault - the overall \"Feel\" of the image and the way it draws the viewer into the photograph  more than makes up for any little technical improvements that could, in retrospect, have improved the image.   What is worth noting is that this image was taken using a Canon 450D, which is a very good consumer level camera - and the photographer may have obtained an even better image using something like a 7D or 5D with the extra ability to work at low light levels and therefore smaller apertures",
  "depth_of_field": "Depth of field, while not obvious in this digital image, can't help but be restricted by the aperture - and ideally I would like to have seen as much of the lane in focus as possible - as this would not have been \"Realistic\", but would have added to the impression of a painting.  However, the depth of field works as it is here as well, but could prove a slight problem if the image was blown up to a large size.",
  "color_lighting": "The colour and lighting give a real sense (to me, at any rate) of something a little magical about this photograph.  The way the centre-ground trees are picked out by the dappled sunlight, the sky, etc., all give this photograph an impression of a painting and more than a chance capture of a gravel road, a wall and some trees.",

You need a fast lens with wide aperture setting, something like the 70-200mm f2.8, or if you can get right up to the stage, a 50mm or 85mm f1.8 so that you get as much light as possible. When pushing the ISO on a body that can't really handle it, you get a lot of \"noise\" as they say, and it brings down the quality of the image in general. As I've pointed out, it is crucial to get the subject's eyes in focus and as sharp as possible for any kind of portrait.I think this is a memorable shot for you with meaning because you were there and got something special from the event.

  "general_impression": "Hello Cara, first of all : my compliments for the original pose and composition ! Technically, the underexposure is the only element keeping this image in the average / good range. For a test shot, like you mentioned in your description, this is a good effort to try something new and see how the different approach \"works\" for you. The fact that you are willing and able to try something new shows the end result can only get better in the long run if you learn how to play with the lighting a bit more; composition-wise, you're high above average already !",
  "subject_of_photo": "As far as sports portraits go, this is a great effort. We all know the \"standard\" shots, but an unusual, catching pose like this one is a shot people will remember. The model looks confident and cool, and the look in his eyes catches the viewers attention as well. Good choice !",
  "composition": "I like the original composition and perspective with the stick pointing towards the camera. The curve of the blade gives it and extra sense of depth. I would have gone for a closer crop; theres's bit too much blank space above the models head to my liking, but overall, a solid composition; well done !",
  "use_of_camera": "You obviously knew what you were doing going for the aperture priority and manual white balance. It would have been hard to keep this image sharp at 1/60 using the lens at 165mm without using flash. The center weighted metering caught a bit too much light I guess, judging from the darker exposure, but good job taking the camera off automatic; this way you've got far more control and are more aware of what you are doing technically, essential if you want to learn from the minor \"mistakes\" you come across in post production when viewing the image on a larger screen.",
  "depth_of_field": "The short depth of field helps to guide your eye towards the models eyes; with a wider depth of field it would have been more difficult to decide where to look without thinking about it; excellent !",
  "color_lighting": "Color looks natural, but overall, the image is a bit too dark. There's detail in all the highlights, but the dark background behind the model \"swallows up\" some of the darker parts of his hair and pads. You could have gone at least a full stop lighter without losing any detail in the highlights.",

I like the informal capture with the musician's hand lazily swinging by his side which says he is confident and at ease playing the instrument - and gives it a nice jazz feel too.",

The horizon line is also a fraction unlevel and easily corrected.",

  "general_impression": "Hi there! Thanks for choosing me to critique your image. I am very impressed with your web sharpening - it looks fantastic so whatever it is you are doing - keep it up. Hopefully you'll find some helpful tidbits in my suggestions for improvement, which will be both technical and creative. ",
  "subject_of_photo": "Cityscape at night. I haven't seen this particularly unique composition before. If this was captured in the US - my guess for the city is Oakland CA, but I truly don't know. This image is slightly more original than your normal cityscape as it has mountains, reflected water, and what appears to be fog.",
  "composition": "Mixed feelings about your composition. It's very professional - I am just not a huge fan of all the negative space, but at least the gradient from light to dark helps ease the transition. Of course, this my subjective opinion and certainly not a \"rule.\" The tallest buildings are slightly off centered. Your shutter speed along with reflected light offers an aesthetic and soothing effect on the water. Overall, your composition seems well balanced although the left side is definitely brighter. What appears to be residential condominiums on the right side of the waterfront adds monotony to the scene. Your straight ahead composition lacks depth, but that is  somewhat offset by the mountains.",
  "use_of_camera": "Personally, if I wanted to achieve a certain length exposure...for example 25 seconds, I'd opt for a higher ISO speed and smaller aperture. Hard to say about your exposure...it looks like you have some clipping in the brightest lights of the city and there appears to be some rasterizing in the sky. For image like this, where the subject matter doesn't appear to be time or wind sensitive I'd recommended bracketing or taking multiple exposures and blending \"by hand.\"",
  "depth_of_field": "Given the huge depth of the scene and your technical specifications I don't see depth of field being a problem here. Although it is difficult to tell give the resolution of your upload and the fact that your foreground is water captured a night. Overall, it appears excellent to me.",
  "color_lighting": "In my opinion, the color cast in your sky is too strong. Otherwise, the lighting looks pretty good. As previously mentioned, you have some noticeable clipping in the city lights, which if possible I recommend trying to recover.",
  "focus": "Focus seems to be excellent although it is difficult to discern the clarity in the fine details based on the resolution of your upload. ",

You have a good eye for BW situations, I see :) The photo makes a really good impression - I almost feel being there at some carnival with beautiful ladies passing by a freshly made wall picture. The situation is timeless and the BW tones add a lot to it. This picture could have ben made 50 years ago, but still look exactly the same. Some technical details might be improved, otherwise - good work!",

  "composition": "I understand it was a matter of seconds, that made this shot possible, but the photo would look much better, if you crop a bit of the top of the picture (to hide the top of the wall and the unnecessary details over the head of the first figure) and turn the picture counterclockwise a bit - to make the line between the people and the painting strictly vertical. This should bring a bit more harmony to the shot. Otherwise the composition is really good - you've managed to combine the two spaces into one, at the same time separating them and giving them their own places in an almost symmetrical composition.",
  "use_of_camera": "positive:1 - the use of the lens. You've chosen the best focal length for the subject!2 - overall exposure is good - a little underexposed, but it really works this time.negative:1 - your ISO is too low2 - and your aperture is not wide enough, and as a result you have rather long exposure (for fast walking people 1/100 of a second is usually too slow)",
  "depth_of_field": "",
  "color_lighting": "The light here is early good - you have no shadows, which leaves less visual difference between the front subjects and the painting. Your black and white tones look almost as if the picture would be taken on a BW film. The low contrast of the mid-tones makes it really pleasant to look at. ",
  "focus": "I am not sure, if the picture is focused ok. As I understand from the enlarged photo, your focus is on the wall, but in my opinion, it should be on the ladies. But as both halves of the picture seem equally important, and I don't know, which is more important to you, this point is arguable.",

Might wish a bit more of the nest were included, but since these nests are often built on man-made structures, I can understand excluding it as well.Also, it would make a slightly stronger photo to have at least one of the young looking in our direction.

The angles at which you captured the temple and the flags are also provocative and engaging. ",

And possibly it was a very windy day. That being said, even assuming both of those statements to be factual, I don't think sacrificing image quality all the way down to ISO 800 was necessary.

The textures and patterns in the image work well to create a sense of smooth and powerful motion in the water. I think your point of view is good.  My brain however wants to see a bit more of the upper part of the water stream as it thinks that it would elongate the nice S curve there (perhaps not but the suggestion of a continued meandering movement is there).  I very much like the smooth peaceful transition of the rapidly moving water, into the calm pool at the bottom right of the frame.  I would have liked to see another rock there for balance, but most times you have to work with what you get in terms of object placement. This is just a personal preference and not a criticism.

However in your description you mention the negative effects gravity has on a community, however I can see no elements of a community in this shot. Further more what you have shown me doesn't really illustrate anything negative and it could be anywhere, my first impression is that this is some narrow road on the outskirts of a town, but I have nothing to go on.

  "composition": "I think overall the composition is pretty good.  I realize that your vision is that the closed ended nature of the pier suggests 'no way out'.  It also however results in a bifurcation of visual continuity to the horizon and forces the eye to backtrack somewhat to take the entire scene in.  I like the diagonal line of the pier as it moves from the rightmost lower corner into the frame. I think a lower point of view would have moved the pier a bit higher in the frame, along with the horizon line and suggested a more present foreground image (pier) resulting in a bit more dynamic presence.

Since you were shooting aperture priority and your camera was thus selecting the shutter speed, I think its safe to say that you could have safely shot at f/8 to f/16 and still maintained a shutter speed of 1/250 or thereabouts.  This would have also ensured a very sharp image throughout the composition with the right focal point. 100 ISO was a good choice for this image considering how much latitude you had in exposure. If you look at your histogram for this image you'll see that you have quite a bit of space on the right side of the graph indicating a paucity of highlights represented.  This tends to dull the image down just a little.  ",

  "general_impression": "Mike as mentioned I like this photograph because it emulates what autumn is and you have  created a very strong composition with the towering yellow trees as the guardians of the forest.",
  "subject_of_photo": "Hello mike !! BEAUTIFUL SHOT of this valley area, the tall yellow trees are for sure the main subject and stand out well in contrast and color.Nicely composed as to the tall yellow tree are shaped in a triangle, very well Photographed I like it very much as it echoes a similar shot of mine.",
  "composition": "Mike compositionally you have thought before your shot and well executed  what you saw and placed it in the view finder beautifully ! As mentioned the mountains enclose a great triangulation and that concept is duplicated by the tall yellow trees. So there are these two elements working very well together. The river below has a nice s curve flow to it from the bottom right to the left , which  gives you  now three triangles can you see all of them ? Excellent !! I just wish I could see a little more of the river, May I suggest try on scenes like this to also shoot from the right this may give you a little more of the river flow. Great contrast between the grassy fields and fir trees.",
  "use_of_camera": "All setting a well done and executed, , try next time to drag the  shutter on the same shot, meaning your shot at  !/80, readjust shutter without any other changes to 1/60 and 1/30 or so. three will do it either way up or down, mostly bracketed down. This way you will have three exposures to view and select the best one with the best density and color range.",
  "depth_of_field": "Great at  F 14 , between the foreground middle ground and background.",
  "color_lighting": "overall mike the color is strong, good balance and contrast, maybe the foreground could be adjusted with a little more density.",
  "focus": "Well done Mike!!  F 14 as you could see in your photoshop produces great edge to edge sharpness and great overall depth.",
  "description": "The intent of this photograph is to convey the splendid color of autumn foliage in a mountain environment. The trees seem almost to be on fire as the sunlight illuminates            ",

  "general_impression": "Hi Lynn,Thanks for choosing me to critique more of your work! I'm delighted to have the chance to critique five of your photos at once and hope you find my comments useful. This particular shot has interesting rhythms in the clouds and the trees but I think the colours are too flat and need some work done in post processing to get the most out of it. Also, I'm assuming your camera is a Nikon D3200 (you've put E3200) so I hope that is correct!",
  "subject_of_photo": "The cloud bands in the photo are quite unusual and I think the sky overall is an interesting subject for a photo. The rhythm of the trees is also nice and works well with the banded clouds.",
  "composition": "As the horizon is placed near the centre of the image, it gives a fairly static feel to the shot and doesn't emphasise the sky. I would have framed the image to cut out a good chunk of the foreground, perhaps half, to concentrate the viewers gaze on the top half of the shot. You could try cropping it in post processing to see if you agree with me. Try to keep the ratio the same as the original. You might also consider 'losing' the post/branches/tree on the right - having three objects lined up like that is a bit odd!",
  "use_of_camera": "Focal length is 8.0 mmm but lens is 20-30 mm??? Something doesn't add up here! But if you used a wide angle lens of about 30 mm then I think that would be ideal for a shot like this as you can get a good wide view in without any distortion. Aside from that, I think your shutter speed is too fast. 1/346 second is unnecessary and means your aperture has to be wider to compensate. In turn, this means a smaller depth-of-field which is not what you want in a landscape shot (see Depth-of-Field below). ISO of 100 is fine but if you had used 200 you would have had a bit more leeway with shutter speed and aperture settings without noticing any increase in digital noise. ",
  "depth_of_field": "F/6.4 is a bit small for a shot like this as it means the objects in the distance will  not be sharply focussed. To create a large depth-of-field you need a bigger f stop (smaller aperture) to get everything in focus.",

  "general_impression": "Hi Stuart,My sense is that your timing was off a bit on this one. Sunsets have their optimal moments, but if you wait too long, even though the sky may still appear beautifully colored, the other parts of the photo become too dark to capture in an appealing fashion. I felt I had to fight too much with this photo to understand what I was looking at and there is nothing other than the orange sky to invite my interest.  ",
  "subject_of_photo": "Dramatic sunsets will always be of great allure to photographers. This setting presented a good opportunity to blend the colorful sky with the water and boats but the picture is too dark to appreciate the moment and there is no obvious center of interest to complement the light.  ",
  "composition": "While the photo is divided nicely into horizontal thirds, the overall appearance is dark and muddied. The composition and perspective, while good, are weakened by an inability to see the boats on the water more clearly. This photo would have benefited from a panoramic cropping to remove the colorless sky at the top of the photo and the darkened water in the foreground. Both areas lack any real interest and could be cropped without harming the overall impact of the photo. ",
  "use_of_camera": "The exposure is very dark in the lower half of the photo. The sky could have tolerated a slight increase in exposure which would have brought out some additional detail in the dark areas of the image. ",
  "depth_of_field": "This type of long shot would benefit from maximum depth of field, so that there is sharp focus all the way to the horizon line. This would require an exposure with a small aperture with the focus on the water in the foreground. Because of the limited light, you may have been able to accomplish this only with the use of a tripod.  ",
  "color_lighting": "The colors in the center horizontal third of the photo - both in the sky and on the water - are very nice, but the rest of the photo is dark and bland and there is nothing there, including the light, to hold the viewer's interest.  ",
  "focus": "The water in the area between the boats looks a little soft. Also the dark object at the far right of the photo looks very blurred. Both of these suggest some camera movement during exposure. I don't know if the boat you were on had set sail yet or was rocking with the tide, but it is more difficult to retain sharpness if you are unable to maintain your balance and shoot with a still body. Often it helps to brace yourself against a wall or some other firm object while shooting.  ",

Its always easy to capture a single bird doing something typically birdlike or graceful, but when you have two this is the sort of juxtaposition that works and creates immediate interest in the subjects, simply because of the interaction that is both overt and implied. I do think that the scene appears to be canted downward slightly from left to right and could benefit from some subtle straightening (not much, but just a litte)  I also like the dichotomy of texture from top of the frame to the bottom where you move, mostly because of the exposure choice, from dark, smooth simplicity, to the ripples and reflections of the birds below.

  "general_impression": "Hi Scott, I like simple subjects that are well photographed and this is a good example of that. Photography is very subjective and different people like different things in an image. If I was shooting this scene I probably would have tried about 10 - 12 different angles and various light settings to see which one I liked most at the end of the shoot. This one has a nice angle, and pleasing feel, but perhaps a little too simple to have a great impact.",
  "subject_of_photo": "I also like leaves on trees with all sorts of things on. I have spent hours photographing water droplets, snow and even insects on similar leaves. I like the colour in this one as well s the imperfections. A simple, yet effective subject.",
  "composition": "I know people harper on about the rule of thirds, but there is a very good reason for this. I like the point of another leaf coming out from the top right corner, but the out of focus bit from the middle top detracts a little from the image. I also would have looked at positioning the main leaf a little more rights and a little lower in the frame. ",
  "use_of_camera": "I have used this kind of camera a lot for underwater imaging and I understand the limitations of it. It seems to me that you used it to about 80% of it's advanced abilities. Obviously the close up focus was necessary, but try playing around with manual exposures as well if you can. Your shutter speed is much higher than necessary, so you could have increased your F stop a little to achieve better DOF.",
  "depth_of_field": "I've mentioned this a few times. It's pretty good, but there is no obvious point of pin sharp focus. So either try to get more of the subject in focus, or less of it. Imagine moving the camera down, pointing it up and having the lowest point of the leaf closest to the lens. Now imagine having only the very tip of that in pin sharp focus. Alternatively, the whole leaf in perfect focus with the background still blurred out.",
  "color_lighting": "I can't fault the lighting or colour balance. I think it's really pleasing.",
  "focus": "Challenging with the equipment you used. I really like the Bokeh in the image, which is achieved by the F2, but for me there is either a little too much DOF (Depth of field) or just not enough DOF. So either the biggest drop on the leaf should have been the only thing in focus, or the whole leaf should have been pin sharp. That is in a perfect world though...",

  "general_impression": "Overall, an interesting photograph of wildlife in the park, but would have been greatly improved by giving a little more space in the photograph to the front and rear of the bird - especially as a zoom lens was used (not sure what the actual focal lenth used was), because in this image, the bird looks a bit squashed within the frame of the image. It would be nice to see contrasting colours, as the bird blends in slightly against the mud.",
  "subject_of_photo": "Yes, it could be an interesting shot, trouble is that there is very little variation of colour.  Not your fault, of course, because with wildlife you can't get your \"models\" to pose where you want them, but have to take them as you find them.  If you have any with stronger colour contrasts, I'd like to see them as well.",

Her look is really good (maybe a little bit more emotions) but this way it is not accentuated as it should be! I really need to see at least a little bit of light in the other side of her face...even just as a silhouette...it would be much more dramatic.

We should see the line of her chin not the line of her arm's shadow. Secondly, I think that this image should have at least 1 light source more. Fill strobe to the (our) left would be pretty good thing to consider.

The wings you caught in motion have a unique feel to them.  Most butterfly images don't capture the butterfly from its underside, nor is the fluid flexing of the wings as evident as in this image. Great job.  I have a few suggestions as to how to maybe present the image in a little stronger light.  It is, however, a very nice composition as is, with nothing else done to it.",
  "subject_of_photo": "This is a very unique presentation of a butterfly.  Because of the way you've captured it, I think it makes for a very interesting and compelling image.  You said you took the shot and hoped you'd get lucky  on it.  You did. ",
  "composition": "I like the placement of the objects.  There is a little more negative space between the Butterfly and the plant stalk than feels comfortable, and I think the plant stalk above the flower seems a bit gangly and distracting.  Of course you didn't set up the shot by placing the elements where they are, but I think there are some things in post processing you can do to assist with the compositional placement and balance and enhance its visual appeal even more. I like that the plant in the lateral background is in soft focus, but because it is, its shape becomes more of an abstract element in the composition and needs to provide 'shape' appeal more so than if it were in sharp resolution.",

I would have liked to have seen the entire leaf edge in the image but it is clipped out of the frame a bit on the top and bottom portions. I feel like the background pattern is a bit busy but could have worked much better for you if you'd have arranged your point of view so that the placement of the leaf situates the internal veins and structure of the leaf more closely with the similar patterns and branch structure of the tree behind it.   The central placement of the leaf is okay, but since it has the top and bottom edges cropped out the left and right sides of the background pattern sort of create a dissonance.  The large portion of tree trunk on the right of the leaf is a nice form but creates an imbalance for me.  ",
  "use_of_camera": "",
  "depth_of_field": "I think it either needs to be much softer to pop the leaf out a bit since it was your desire to capture the essence of the internal structures of the leaf via some back lighting, or increase your apparent depth of field to take advantage of the similar patterns in the tree that mimic the leaf.

  "color_lighting": "I could not speak to camera exposure settings here since there wasn't any information supplied.  Overall I think the light on the leaf is good and the exposure allows for some nice detail there.  The colors here confound me a bit. The background appears to have a lot of purple fringing around the branches which is a sort of chromatic aberration cause by a lenses inability to resolve difficult bright lighting around dark small edges. However when I tried to remedy the issue in Photoshop the fringing was very persistent and resisted most of my efforts.  Nonetheless there is a definite magenta and blue fringing that occurs there.

  "general_impression": "Hi David,The improvement of your abilities is very clear just in these two shots, but the previous one was a great photograph and this is not a bad one but it's particularly interesting. We also have a few other problems on this one that were not present on the previous and have things that improved. The shadows a far better here but maybe now you went a bit to far to the other side. We have many areas that have gone without texture. Same thing with the highlights. You have some texture on the windows but you could have just a bit more. On top you can see that the wholes in the grid are totally white and indistinguishable from the margin.This is a big step forward and these errors that we still have here are a great learning experience. Be careful not to loose texture on the shadows and highlights but don't go the other way like in the previous one. Shadows are supposed to be dark even if we get all texture on them, and the same goes for brightness in the highlights, not loosing texture.I can see that there is an appeal on the side of the church but this composition looks like this is a detail from a bigger picture.Regarding the vertical lines this is a good attempt but you have to do what I suggested in my message earlier. In this one you went a bit beyond the parallel position.Keep following the good advice and you'll far soon!Cheers",

  "general_impression": "Hi Dale,  Thanks for sharing your image with me.  One of my favorite places to go is the high desert.  I think this is a pretty good image.  It has some minor compositional and lighting and color issues that you can address to improve the 'curb appeal'I think.  ",
  "subject_of_photo": "The desert in winter is always a compelling subject Dale.  Its seems almost paradoxical that such an arid place that bakes most of the year under a relentless sun, would also experience the extreme lows of winter temperatures.  Capturing the contrasting elements is always an eye catcher.  ",
  "composition": "I think that though there are some nice elements to the image, it presents a bit static.  I think part of this has to do with the placement of the horizon line pretty much in the center of the composition. With a featureless sky (no clouds)placement of the horizon in the center gives the sky as much visual weight as the foreground and thus distracts somewhat from the elements there.  Also I think that the horizon's slight slant upwards from the left side to right creates a feeling of unbalance in the image.  I think the placement of the tree on the left third of the image works well and its placement is pleasing. I like the tree but because of the play of light and shadows it tends to disappear into the background.  The lighting of the foreground is not sufficiently different from the background to give you a sense of depth and so things appear flatter than they would otherwise appear.  ",
  "use_of_camera": "I think overall its pretty good.  Snow is always a little challenging and your camera wants to expose the snow, when using an evaluative metering mode, to middle gray.  So right out of the camera the snow tends to be a bit gray and the rest of the shadows darker than you may desire them to be.  While the exposure here isn't too bad, its a bit dark and there is some color cast to the snow as well.  ",
  "depth_of_field": "good.  Acceptably sharp throughout the image plane.",
  "color_lighting": "I think the image is somewhat dark.  As a result the shadows dominate and a lot of the nice areas of sunlight tend to go to the background and become less noticable.  There is also an overall blue cast to the image, (not unusual in a snow image), that can be corrected with a post processing software by adjusting the white balance.  ",

  "general_impression": "Hi Kevin, this is an excellent shot ! You managed to catch exactly the right moment, and gave the moment something extra by framing the pitcher in a non-traditional way. The balance between shadow and sunny highlights adds to the overall atmosphere of the image; an excellent baseball shot !",
  "subject_of_photo": "Baseball is a popular sport with a lot of different types of action you can capture. Taking a good shot of a pitcher in action isn't as easy it seems, and greatly depends on the angle you can shoot from, the technique the pitcher uses, and the environment on and surrounding the field. These factors add up, and can turn \"just another average shot of a baseball pitcher\" into an image that really catches your attention and stands out. The combined factors are something you have to learn how to spot, and it's exactly what you did here. The combination of the right moment, the shadow and the sunny field behind the pitcher and the composition make this an excellent subject ! ",
  "composition": "The higher vantage point helps to separate the pitcher from his surroundings, and the vertical crop eliminates possible distractions around him, and gives the pitcher more \"length\". The composition adds sufficient \"room\" above the pitcher as well. I might have considered cropping just a little bit lower at the top to make the background behind him more uniform. Cropping the entire image just a bit tighter makes the action look \"bigger\" , but isn't really a must; this composition works just fine because of the uniform \"space\" around the pitcher.",
  "use_of_camera": "You really thought about which camera settings to use. A slightly higher ISO rating to keep the action \"frozen\" with a 1/2000 shutter speed, and just enough depth of field to keep the pitcher and his clothing in focus (using a range extender for your lens as well, judging from your technical data). In difficult lighting, with several F-stops between the sunny and the shadowy area's in frame. Good job !",

  "color_lighting": "Like I mentioned earlier : you caught a good balance between the sunny and shadowy areas of this image, which isn't easy, especially at higher ISO ratings. The image could have used a bit more contract to my liking, but the color looks natural in sunny weather; shadowy areas in images like this one tend to turn out too blue, and you managed to avoid that, well done !",
  "focus": "Focus is spot on the pitcher's face and leaves the background nicely out of focus with the 4.8 aperture. No room for criticism here !",

  "general_impression": "David,  Its obvious you have a good eye for landscapes and this image is no exception. There are some housekeeping details that you can address here, and some lighting and point of view considerations for you.  I really have little to critique in this image, but here's a few thngs to consider.  ",
  "subject_of_photo": "I like this image because it is subtly paradoxical. The subject is primarily the visual juxtaposition of a rural, pastoral scene, with a pleasantly invasive a red, phone booth. ",
  "composition": "Overall I think the composition is well done.  All the interesting visual elements are evenly distributed throughout the frame which gives it a nice balanced look.  There is a suggestion of a curvy road entering from the left side of the image but it disappears before we can see its entirety. Part of it appears again on the right most side of the image moving left into the frame.  I would have liked to have seen the entire road as I think its curvilinear shape would have provided a very nice leading line into the image providing a continuity that the current point of view does not.  There is a power or telephone line that appears on the right side of the frame halfway down.  It doesn't provide the same sense of irony that the phone booth does and can be a sort of minor distraction to the eye.  ",

  "depth_of_field": "",
  "color_lighting": "The colors here are pleasing to the eye.  I like the nice complimentary nature of the single red phonebooth amongst all the greenery.  It works well.  I think as it presents here, the image could use some more brightness as it is a bit dull and doesn't highlight all the subtle colors and hues that are there.  I also think that it is a bit dark, particularly in the lower left part of the frame where the phonebooth sits next to a small copse of trees. There is a little bit of blow out in the white areas of the image, particularly the expanse of cloud space and the small white house in the lower part of the scene.  Not huge issues but in the clouds in particular I think there is some room to bring out more detail there. ",

Having decades of experience with negative film - I knew if held at just the right angle - a positive image can appear. This would be a kind of reverse solarisation but, this is a digital camera. The halos around the birds may mean they were pasted into the sky, or the whole image is a negative. The clue which made me see it immediately was the shadows under the birds wings were white, and the highlights on the wing tops were black. Then the legs and beaks were white...that ain't right.",

It's a good, but difficult subject to get a good shot of, especially in harsh light, and on the ground with all of the obstructions. There's a couple of twigs in the way which with a little bit of gentle editing you could remove them from the shot but getting the composition right is more important.

You have a great eye for seeing beauty and form in an unusual spot.  Most people would not have seen this.  Your choice to process this in Black and White was perfect. The opposites in this image a what make it really stand out.  The straight lines against the curves.  The soft smooth edges against the hard.",

Maybe if you lowered your camera just a little you light have been able to center the farther pipe between the bottom of the road and the reflection of the guard rail.

This was mid day and lighting can be harsh.  You have managed to control the exposure beautifully though out the scene. No blown out highlights or blocked up shadows.  There is plenty of detail inside the pipes, this allows the viewers eye to wander inside there a bit too and enjoy the reflected light.",

  "general_impression": "Michele.  Thank you for sharing this (and your other images as well).  This is a particularly nice scene in terms of color, textures, composition and mood.  Below are some ideas you may wish to consider in bringing out the fine attributes of this image.  ",
  "subject_of_photo": "Michele, What a very beautiful and serene scene.  I very much like the painterly effect here.  . I'm not sure how much post production work you did on this image, such as tone mapping, etc, but the lighting effect here is very nice. ",
  "composition": "I very much like the lines and placement of form in this composition.  The body of water gently curves in and upwards from the lower right frame, suggesting a classic sort of s-curve.  The horizon line, which I would normally not place right in the center of the composition, works well here because the image relies upon the symmetry of the reflected clouds for its sense of balance and interest.  For example I might have dropped the horizon line lower in the composition to emphasize the clouds if there wasn't such a nice reflection of them in the lower half of the image.  I think the sidewalk on the left frame of the image is okay, but I think it is a little bit of a distraction in that it, albeit realistically, detracts from the sense of nature and solitude by bringing in a reminder that this is not necessarily a little remote lake, but perhaps part of a community or a park. The horizon line is also just a bit skewed, not much mind you, but enough to be noticable.  ",
  "use_of_camera": "It appears that you were using program mode for your shot and evaluative (multi-segment) light metering.  In this case the camera adjusts aperture and shutter speed based upon your input or selection of ISO and or other exposure compensations.  It appears the camera did a very nice job of balancing the exposure, considering that the scene contains a very hot spot where the sun is in the upper left of the frame.  Program AE works very well in many situations and it did here. But it is not necessarily always the best choice when shooting landscapes and you may wish to consider moving to an aperture priority based exposure strategy as it allows you more control over depth of field which in turn allows you more control over what areas of your image you chose to direct attention to those aspects of the scene you choose to highlight for your viewer.  ",
  "depth_of_field": "Very deep from foreground to infinity.  Appropriate for this composition I think.",
  "color_lighting": "Beautiful to say the least.  The light looks like morning light to me (although I suppose it could also be evening light).  The quality of it is ethereal and saturated at the same time.  I think overall the image is exposed very well.  There is a bit of a hot spot where the cloud detail is blown out near the sun flare in the upper left of the image.  This pulls the eye a bit in that direction and away from the main compositon.  But this isn't particularly egregious in this case. ",
  "focus": "The focus appears to be very sharp and clear to me.",

This story teller of yours is fantastic !!!!!,and leaves me to wonder of all the inmates that passed or didnt pass through this prison. The man below adds to the now and then and the mystique of it all leading your eye from him to the center window. The crusty walls helps add a flavor  of those who past in and out of this prison as well as the shadows of the rail posts, ghosts of  the past perhaps.  Just superb in story telling Joe! comp, color and contrast !!  As said by a few including my father a master Photgrapher who has said of  a few Photographs , quote \" I wish I had taken that shot\"",
  "subject_of_photo": "Hello Joe ! Superb Photograph !  Where do I start, excellent Story Teller and that is what makes a great Photograph over all, what it prevails to the viewer, and this photgraph of yours says alot, plus if only the walls could talk. Compostion lighting, contrast depth of field, color, all executed  perfectly !! ",
  "composition": "Joe, your compostion is well thought out !! The diagonal lines from the top and lower thirds, of the wiring and rails is very strong in support of guiding your eyes from the bottom and sides to the man lower third  middle  straight to the blue window dead center. Adding is the supurb depth of field this all creates. Only   one area I noticed it seems slighty shot from the right, railing posts are uneven, this is the only  very small fault I find with your shot, maybe because you hand held, you may have not noticed it, however joe  again very small fault.

  "color_lighting": "Joe,the brown and blue tones work together wonderfully, and the contrast on the side walls and detail of the aging building along with the shadows of the railing posts, are captured beautifully, and add to the bewonderment of a time  past and what it still holds.

I can see why you shot this image and I can imagine that when you took it your eye saw so much more of the detail than is currently apparent in the image. Below are some suggestions that may help in the future, and also in bringing out this images inherent qualities.",
  "subject_of_photo": "Jean-Claude, I think this image has some hidden charms to it.  But I also think the way its presented  doesn't compliment its hidden potential very well.  As it now stands, it isn't a particularly compelling or interesting image. ",
  "composition": "I think the composition of this image is fair.  There are some nice individual elements, colors and tonal areas here but they don't come together well for me. There are few strong leading lines here, and the lines that are, don't take the eye anywhere in particular.  A road is always a good method to use when you want to provide some depth and a pathway into the image, but in this case the road is bifurcated, and is only shown in pieces throughout the image.   . ",
  "use_of_camera": "This is a difficult exposure.  The sun glare off of the ocean results in an underexposure of the darker areas of the image, specifically the foreground rocks, where a lot of nice color and tone exists but is not readily visible. I think, since you were using shutter priority mode, that the camera set the aperture at f/13 based upon the cameras metering mode, in this case multi segment.  I think you may have been better served using a center weighted or spot metering to find a mid tone dark area and use that area to lock your exposure.  That way I think you may have brought out some more of the dark detail in the foreground rock.  But, then you would have further blown out the ocean and distant hills.  Like I said, this was a difficult situation to shoot in a single shot because of the large dynamic range.  ",
  "depth_of_field": "I think the Depth of field is just fine here and is sufficiently sharp and deep as it should be for this type of image.  ",
  "color_lighting": "I think the image is a bit too bright on the top of the frame(background distance)and too dark at the bottom, or foreground area. Fortunately the data, except for the ocean highlights, is still mostly there and can be brought back to life in post processing. I don't know if you are aware of the extent of brilliant color and tonal area in the dark rock area in the middle foreground, right.  As the image is currently exposed it appears to suffer from both a dullness on the ocean and distant hills and blocked up shadows in the dark rock formations.   ",
  "focus": "The focus looks good as far as I can tell from the limited resolution.  The dark exposure of the foreground makes it immediately difficult to ascertain the edge detail.",

I have little to say relative to improvement, however you may wish to consider the following suggestions and observations regarding your image. ",
  "subject_of_photo": "Great subject here.  Besides being a visually compelling image, it also suggests a metaphorical story  of balance and dualism.  I love the almost whimsical nature of a rather rustic and dilapidated structure with a new tractor parked in the driveway so to speak.  ",
  "composition": "I like the placement of all your elements here.  The building and tractor are pleasingly residing in the right hand third of the image, the horizon line is placed below center frame to emphasize the sky, yet there is wonderful hue texture and detail in the lower background which features interesting forms and a soft line of mist.  There is a subtle diagonal composition formed from the lower right corner to the upper left that is formed by the subtle structure of the clouds and the visual cues of the tractor and building as they rise from the corner of the frame into the clouds.",
  "use_of_camera": "I think your settings were good enough to capture the scene pretty well.  I think a tripod might have been in order here considering the lighting conditions.  The bright sky here will always result, in most conditions, in a darkened foreground.  But it appears that you struck a harmonious balance in the exposure.  I realize you wanted a deep depth of field so f/11 was a pretty good choice but it resulted in a relatively slow shutter speed of 1/60 for a hand held shot in fading light.  I think a larger aperture of perhaps f/8 or so, if you had to shoot hand held, would be safer in similar lighting situations. Nonetheless you have detail where it counts.",
  "depth_of_field": "good and deep.  No need for a shallow DOF here.  ",
  "color_lighting": "I think the lighting is wonderful here.  I have no idea how it looked straight out of the camera, and I know that you have applied some post processing and can't be sure to what extent that changed the image relative to shadow exposure.  The sky is of course tremendous.  However the foreground shadow detail is a bit dark (particularly in the right most corner by the tractor) and I believe could be brighter to reveal some of the detail there. The luminosity of the sky is stellar and really makes for a magical mood.  There is a bit of a cast, but a desirable one in this case as it renders the scene warm and golden. ",

  "general_impression": "Hi Luke, this is a very competent well executed starlight photograph. The composition with the star patters going from the bottom of the frame to the top is interesting and holds the viewers attention to explore the whole of the frame of view. The orientation is good in that it intimates the vastness of the subject matter. You say this is stitched from 4 originals-you have done a great job on this there are no lines between the joins, this is difficult particularly with areas of continuous tone (sky). You also have delivered on your concept of the photograph as it was shot in sections and assembled in post production-well done",
  "subject_of_photo": "I like these starlight photographs they really show the versatility of digital for low light photography. Inclusion of the landscape is really important for these images as it adds a context and a sense of scale hence 10 out of 10 for this section.",
  "composition": "The use of portrait or vertical orientation of the image gives us a sense of space, it also follows the track of most peoples gaze when they look at the sky at night. the light areas on the bottom right are distracting (to me).",
  "use_of_camera": "The exposure for the sky is correct there is enough detail to show the individual stars as well as clouds of luminance. I like the silhouette of the trees they add scale & a sense of timelessness to the shot. Your shutter speed was long enough to show the highlight of the stars, record the mid tones in the sky  without showing any appreciable tracking due to the Earths rotation.",

Here are some ideas you may wish to consider.  ",
  "subject_of_photo": "Birds always provide a great potential source of elegant and graceful art imagery.  This image has many interesting facets and qualities.  ",
  "composition": "Bird images while naturally compelling, tend to fall into two categories . in fact all wildlife images fall into these two basic categories.  The first being unique compelling images that capture the bird or animal in its natural environment actively doing what it does. Others present the bird in a more portrait or static orientation to the viewer where the image presents more like a still portraiture.  I think this image, while containing compelling elements of texture color and tonal values, is by and large a presentation image.  I am not particularly excited about the cutting off of the birds legs where you did.  I would have liked, for this image anyway, to see the entirety of the bird for balance and form reasons.  I do like the abstract effect created by the background blurring which coordinates well with the colors and textures of the birds feathers.  The placement of the bird on the leftmost third of the image works well I think.  ",
  "use_of_camera": "I think the image is sharp despite your choice of a shutter speed of 1/60th.  This is risky ground due to the propensity to blur or shake your image using such a long focal length 280mm) relative to shutter speed. However your aperture setting allowed you to create a very nice Bokeh behind the bird and subtly fade your sharp focus appropriately as you moved to the far edges of the bird and back into the background.

  "color_lighting": "I think your image is exposed well, although just a little flat in the luminance area.  This flatness is not something that can't be adjusted nor is it particularly strong. The exposure is simply that there are a great number of pixels dedicated to the mid to upper mid tone areas of the tonal range.  ",

I absolutely love the expression on his face (I am assuming he is a boy so send me a message if Im wrong!). You have captured a very candid moment and it looks as if you caught him by surprise. This makes for a very fun and candid photograph, so well done on catching an emotionally strong subject. Such a cheeky grin!",

I am unable to tell what your aperture setting was used here but it looks like your camera focused on the background instead of the subject. In this case I would be using an aperture of f8 or above. Anything lower, given your close proximity to the subject, could result in soft focus if you are working fast. Of course if you are going to use a greater depth of field, you will also need to bump up your ISO to compensate to get a correct exposure.",
  "color_lighting": "From the image I can see it was a very dark and overcast day. When you have conditions like that you can't do much about the lighting.

I would be curious as to what focusing mode you were using on your camera when you took this shot. The main subject is a bit soft for me , especially the eyes, and not as sharp as it could be. I noticed you are using a Nikon D3X. I am not experienced with that camera, but my Nikon has subject tracking auto focus.

  "general_impression": "Hi there Pete. Firstly, thank you for asking me to provide feedback on your photo. The subject is a difficult one to get right but you have managed to do a good job all round. The important areas, the bird and flower are nicely focussed and crisp, although as a result of the intense direct light, there is a fair shadow over the birds head. Choosing the right time to capture these shots is important although there is a balance to be struck as you want the sunlight to show the iridescence of the birds feathers. With any luck, you will have found the critique helpful but if you have any specific questions, feel free to send me a message via the messaging service here.Kind regardsKen",
  "subject_of_photo": "The hummingbird feeding is a great image to capture and even if you hadn't managed to capture the shot, the experience of just watching this beautiful bird is fantastic.",
  "composition": "Composition is ok but there are a lot of distracting factors. The branch on the right cuts right through your image and cuts the right wingtip off and the leaf to the left is also very distracting.",
  "use_of_camera": "Exposure is good but I would have slowed the shutter speed slightly to show a little more movement in the wings. In doing so you could also have reduced the ISO and therefore reduce the noise impact. Wherever possible use the lowest ISO that your camera can give you.",
  "depth_of_field": "The depth of field here is very good. The background is nicely blurred and do not impact on the central features.",
  "color_lighting": "The colours in the flower and hummingbird are quite good given the intensity of light that is shining on the flower. The oranges could be boosted slightly but be careful not to over-do this but the greens and blue in the bird are great.",
  "focus": "Focus on the Hummingbird and the flower are very good and just as the focus should be in this shot.",

  "general_impression": "John, this is a wonderful image.  I really don't have much to say in regards to improvements.  In fact what I do have to say is very minor and more in the line of housekeeping.  Very very nice image.  Thank you for sharing.",
  "subject_of_photo": "I very much appreciate the strong metaphorical story telling nature of this image.  The painter, absorbed in his art, oblivious to the crashing surf, and reflecting as in a mirror, the scene in front of him and what is not immediately available to the viewer.",
  "composition": "This image is simple and well composed.  There aren't a lot of leading lines, s curves, or other cues that lead the eye into the frame.  Instead this is accomplished by the placement of the objects.  You've used the rule of third judiciously and well.  Also, although the frame is separated pretty much in half from a design standpoint, the human point of interest resides in the lower third of the image, and the crashing surf on the opposing side.  So here we have an otherwise static image where half the frame is in frantic motion.  Meanwhile the static side where the painter is, seems to take no notice of the chaos next to him.  This sort of harmonic dissonance is very appealing.  I also like the posture of the painter.  He is leaning to the side while in rapt attention to his canvas.  He gingerly holds his extra brushes in his left hand and the symmetry and balance of the form is very nice. You can tell he is in motion, yet a controlled motion to be sure.",
  "use_of_camera": "I think the lighting, the contrast, focus, DOF, and exposure is tack on.  There are no harsh shadows, and the textures and contours are well defined.  ",
  "depth_of_field": "Perfect",
  "color_lighting": "I like the hues and muted colors in this image.  I would say that it would lend itself well to a black and white rendition, but I think you'd lose the impact of the painting reflecting his environment if you did.  I also think that there is a slight blue cast to the image.  This is not a fatal flaw, and some may prefer it. . but it is noticeable.",

  "composition": "The placement of the girl is excellent between the tree , framing her. One strong suggestion with a shot like this , you  should shot this type of portait vertically, that way I can see more of her and  it would help reduce the tree on the right side and still maintain the impact of the v shape created by the tree's two trunks. depth and contrast are well produced in your shot, depth by the shallow depth of field by use of  f5, blurring the leaves in the background. The arm on the tree placement is Excellent Chris because it frames her wihtin the frame  this helps  a portait image become stronger  Well done !! ",

One element  that has trouble is the hot spot on her right forehead on an angle. either have her move foreward a little if possible, and or if not then use your photoshop to tone it down , more darker.",

The colors would have been the first thing to draw me to this image if I were out with my camera.  I think that it is a very nice photo but compositionally it could be improved, and the exposure and thus sharpness could be better as well.  I think some of your post processing work served to detract a bit from the finished product rather than improve it.  I'm referring to your work on the shimmering reflection.  I do like that you've brightened the highlights on the dock.  Some of the highlighting on the water is a bit uneven and there are portions that appear like bright hot spots on the water as a result. (see lower right and left sides of the water shimmer effect, its very bright blue compared to the rest of the water around it.  It should, I think, fade off a little more gradually.  ",
  "subject_of_photo": "Thanks for sharing this Maureen. I too shoot a lot of water scenes where the main subject is a solitary dock. I find them compelling. I think this image has much possibility as an iconic, Zen like image, with some considerations that I will discuss below. I like the amount of dock in the image but there are some issues for me with its placement in this case.",
  "composition": "I think the overall composition of this image is just okay.  I think dock placement high in the frame, transitioning across the image slightly at a diagonal, moves a bit too much laterally and straight across the screen.  As a result its a bit static and comes into the frame high on the left side of the image and leaves a vacuum and imbalance on the lower left of the image. I think the post processing to the water shimmer is a bit over done.  I think the original shimmer may have worked better.  I say this because the lower part of the reflection is a bit skewed and unnatural, and doesn't match up, shape wise, with the continuity of the entire reflection.  Also I see a lot of pixel distortion around the shimmer where you've widened it.  It is very obvious that something has been done. (see the smudgy texture from the pixels being overly filtered and manipulated, like a dark halo around the lower portion of the reflected shimmer. ",
  "use_of_camera": "I think the exposure and speed was workable for this image.  The camera was on a tripod so camera shake shouldn't have been too much of an issue.  The four second exposure would have allowed for some softening of the water detail of course since it is always in motion. The dock however, even with the long exposure you would expect to be more sharp.  Was there wind, vibration on the ground where you were, etc. . ? The ISO was only 200 so while you end up with a more noise free image, you do have to use a slower exposure (shutter speed), and/or a more wide open aperture. ",
  "depth_of_field": "",
  "color_lighting": "The colors and lighting on this image are its most compelling and captivating aspect.  I love the deep cobalt blue of the sky and the darkened waters, as well as the rich salmon  colored light of the fading sunset. The subtle greens and aquas of the furthermost water area also blends well with the colors and provides a good deep feeling to the image. ",
  "focus": "I think the focus here looks a bit soft.  Upon close inspection of the dock edges and water detail the image is not tack sharp.  I think upon ",

All ten shades of the gray scaled are covered. ",

This ofcourse roots to cropping when shooting , remember always leave more room in all shots so you have the choice to crop  later for appeal and  composition. The angle  should have  been taken vertically, not horizontally, because the true nature ofcourse is  the position of the light should be upright. The contrast  is ok , but I suggest it could be adjusted to darken the center white siding, enough  not to take away from the light and the shadow of the light.marquee the area and use the slider in exposure cs6.   Being a straight on shot of a building wall, it does lack depth to a degree, although the curvature of the conduit to the light does help.",

  "general_impression": "Thanks Denise for choosing me to review your photo!First of all, your total rating is 8.1, not 7.0. It was showing correct rating until I saved my review. All of the sudden it showed 7.0.I even calculated ratings by sections and number of sections and it says 8.1. So your total is 8.1.That said, let's move forward!I like it! I like the subject, composition needs just a little more tweaks. Reflections combined with abstract patterns are also a great idea. Making nature patterns and artificial patterns work together is always a great challenge! But, I can see you know your way with camera and other \"stuff\" important in photography. So I'll write just some little remarks for you to improve your skills in the future!Keep on taking pictures!!!",
  "subject_of_photo": "I had very similar (if no the same) structure recently on critique and I liked it very much. I also like this subject (which I think it's the same as the one I mentioned). Abstract patters that collide with clean and uniform patterns of the glass part make a pretty interesting and rewarding subject.",
  "composition": "Composition is just a tiny bit confusing, but since I don't know how that object looks like for real I can't be too critical. It seems that the building  is not completely straight in all parts in reality! So one should be careful not to make composition too \"extravagant\"! ;) I don't like bottom part of glass structure because there is some dark reflection there (a building or mountain or something) that disrupts overall cleanness of the image. Also in that part (the most bottom part) we can see a part of some sign or panel which also brings up the point I mentioned.",
  "use_of_camera": "Your photo is just a bit underexposed and it lacks a bit more contrast but that's not a big deal.",
  "depth_of_field": "",
  "color_lighting": "Sky reflections is a great idea. I wish there were much more red clouds. The most of the glass part is empty and you don't want to do that with the subject like this!!! This way it leaves this photo unfinished. Almost like a test shot to see what more great stuff could be done with this subject.",
  "focus": "It looks mostly in focus...I would close the aperture down so most of the frame would be in focus!",

You also state you're just beginning with the HDR technique so what you've shown here is quite the norm: overdone technique.HDR is by its' nature very easy to go over the top with.

  "subject_of_photo": "Hi Robert,How I'd love to see this shot in the original size...Words aren't enough to describe the beauty of this dragonfly, and you've done a great job here. It's a great subject! Top score. The simplicity and impact of this image is undoubtedly very strong.Well Done!!",
  "composition": "Usually we tend to fall on the easiness of following the basic rules and that is almost always boring. A trained photographic eye has more enjoyment in the alternatives that it has in the same old thing. We like to see new things and new ways to look at them. I'm saying this here, regarding the composition, because you're not stuck to the rule of thirds. Not that we shouldn't use it but that we must go beyond it's rigidity and find less obvious way to convey our subjects. And going away from what is confirmed it work is hard and needs skill and sensibility.You've given this Red Dragon enough space for it to breathe in the surrounding area, and the fact that you've chosen to give more space to the top and left puts it in a position of achievement. It's not about where it came from but where it will go. If you had framed it strictly according to the rule of thirds this would not have the same intention. Firstly because the mere fact of framing by the book is less capable of giving the profundity of meaning that you have here (some people just do it because the book says to). Secondly because this way we have a more intimate relation with the dragonfly without loosing all framing intention. To just have it very close so that we could perfectly see the eyes and other details would not be so interesting as a shot but more as a piece of evidence, good for science.Also, by framing it the way you did, it's the Dragon that has the predominant presence as the animal that it is and not only as the incredible shape that it has or very vivid and compelling colour we see. This is not just a graphical image, this is a very dynamic image.Although the focus is not on the eyes, something that for us humans is always distracting or disturbing (the first thing we look at when we see an animal are the eyes) because it forces a non relation and we have to search for the focus. I don't dislike this but the subtlety you have here on it is not making it work as well as if it was \"made on purpose\" and very well thought of.",
  "use_of_camera": "I don't really have anything to add here... you did exactly what you had to achieve the goal.",
  "depth_of_field": "The DoF is on spot, totally isolating the dragonfly from the background and giving the shot it's simplicity and amazing feel. It's the focus that could be improved not the DoF. It could be f5.6 to have a little more DoF without loosing the feel you have and selection from the background but f4 also works well.",
  "color_lighting": "These are really amazing colours! The red against the green is just superb. And the light green of the grass crossing the frame diagonally is really making this picture be as dynamic as it seems you felt it should be. And this is working perfectly with the framing, great work.",
  "focus": "I'm addressing this item strictly on a technical point of view... as I said above, the eyes are what we look at in first place and because there is no visible indication that you had the intention of having them out of focus, not is there a clear result work well from that,  I fell obliged to give you a lower rating here. But this is hard for me because I can't really see how far or close from focus the eyes are.This is the hardest item to answer because the image size we have here in Gurushots is not big enough for us to assess with rigour where the focus is exactly. I can perfectly see the segments of the eyes but it's not as sharp as the legs or the wings where they meet the torso.",

Is it a captured moment?  If so what is that moment?   I don't have a good answer which leads me to conclude it is a portrait of some kind and one most appreciated by the family.  At the same time, notice how the ball also distracts from the baby too.  This first thing I thought was...\"whats up with the ball?\"  Did the baby throw it?  Did someone else?  Whats it doing there?",
  "composition": "Framing is top heavy andcluttered.  I like this unexpected angle on the baby (from behind) as a portrait.  It is strong and compelling.  Unfortunately the position of the ball in frame subliminally makes it appear like the baby is looking at it...which is a little odd.  I can't help but feel this shot would be stronger as a horizontal with more alley flowing off to the left (where the baby is looking).

  "general_impression": "Hi Deigh! Your technical execution of your creative vision here is spectacular.  I can almost feel the water moving and the fog swirling above.  Excellent job filling your frame with your primary message/subject as we are able to enjoy your image with few distractions. I especially like your use of black and white to help convey an even stronger mood.  Overall, very well done - just a couple of minor composition and exposure recommendations to make a great image even stronger.  Nicely done and thank you for sharing your work with me!",
  "subject_of_photo": "If you were hoping to capture \"the power of the river against the fog and steam...,\" you have wildly succeeded in doing so in your image.  You have so effectively filled your frame entirely with that message, so there is no question what the subject is here.",
  "composition": "Two things grab me right away with your composition: your layers and lines.  The image possesses a strong illusion of depth because of how you've utilized the rocks in the foreground, the river in the middle, another set of rocks with trees on top, and interspersed fog towards the top of the frame. All of these components convey excellent spatial relationship between the different visual objects.  While a significant portion of the visual weight (heavier objects and darker tones) fall towards the top of the image (which makes the image feel a little top heavy if you consider our perceptions of gravity...), you have created a nice sense of overall asymmetrical balance by positioning the river and foreground rocks as you have.It's an even bigger payoff when your foreground rocks create a triangle shape and your river line runs from bottom left to top right (or vice versa).  These both create a sense of movement across your entire frame. Also, your elevated perspective provides a nice angle to view this scene - it feels like we're soaring above it or enjoying from an overlook.If we remember that the viewer's eye is most attracted to the brightest part of the frame, I find my eye goes immediately to the bottom left corner.  Because that tone sits on the edge of the frame, it's serving to pull the viewer's eye out of the frame.  I'd recommend either selectively darkening that corner so it serves as a stronger visual anchor (and thus, keeps the eye in the frame vs. pulling it out of it) OR crop the frame from the bottom.  I would not recommend cropping from the right side to remove this tone, as the fallen trees serve as effective lines pointing back to your primary subject - the river.Also, the darkened/silhouetted tree breaks up the line of the river towards the top of the frame simply because the tones differ significantly from the whiter-toned river.  Not much you can do to resolve that (especially if you're standing on the edge of a cliff!!), other than to just simply be aware of its existence and position yourself to get the best angle possible (which I believe you've done).  To emphasize and frame the line of the river a little more effectively, I would have liked to have seen a little more of the rocks on the left side (so in the field spin your camera to left an inch or two towards those rocks).",
  "use_of_camera": "Your choice of shutter speed and ISO speed were tremendously effective in rendering movement in the water AND retaining structure and shape with the waves.  Overall the exposure looks well done.  With the black and white treatment, you have a nice range of tones from bright white to rich black.  If anything, I'd like to see a little more detail in the blacks/shadows especially along the banks of the river (could just be my monitor too...), so reducing the contrast just a tick would help resolve that.Because the image looks sharp from front to back, your aperture setting yielded an effective depth of field range.",
  "depth_of_field": "",
  "color_lighting": "The overall lighting looks fairly even toned so you aren't going to see a great deal of contrast in the color version of this frame.  The diffused and foggy lighting conditions not only afforded you the chance to use a slow shutter speed, but also helped to create a moody scene.  As such, it was a very smart decision to drop the color out and create the contrast via your black and white treatment.  In fact, the monochrome effect enhances the moodiness of the overall photograph.",
  "focus": "Depth of field looks spot on.  Everything from the foreground rocks to the background trees look sharp as a tack.",

I'd strongly encourage you to find some continuing education classes that will help teach you to use the camera in one of the manual modes giving you much greater control over what the camera is doing.If you have a strong interest in wildlife photography then please spend some time on the web looking at some great wildlife photography images to see what makes them work.  Photographers to look at are Wayne Lynch, Art Wolfe, Arthur Morris or in a pinch, some of my wildlife images.  You'll start to see the sort of elements that go into making a good wildlife image.Keep working on it and I hope to see more of your work.Best regards,Paul",

  "general_impression": "Hi Petros, Overall, this is a lovely shot and I like the colours and the detail. It conjures up lots of descriptive words like defiant, spiky, wiry, fading, dying, beauty, frizzy, and others plus I like the subtle drops of water. My only real criticism is the framing is slightly off and perhaps some cropping would be appropriate which I've mentioned below.",
  "subject_of_photo": "This is an unusual shot of a flower as it is obviously 'past its best' and I really like the fact that you have chosen to make it the subject of a photograph as so often we expect flowers to be shown at their best. However, it's an interesting image and I like the poetic concept of the 'injured beauty of an overlooked creature'. This must be art!",
  "composition": "I think the composition is ok but could have been better if you had stood a little to your right so that the flower and the dark area in the background lined up. Also that would have put the subject more in line with the Rule of Thirds. The perspective is fine, with the viewer just a tiny bit below the centre of the flower, and I like the strong contrast between the flower in the foreground and the mysterious green shapes in the background. Overall, it's good.",
  "use_of_camera": "I think the exposure is good especially as you have managed to separate the foreground and background at the same time. ISO 200 is good for photographing flowers (not too much digital noise) and the white balance is good, with natural-looking colours. I think Aperture Priority was a good choice as the most important thing here was to isolate the background by choosing a wide aperture.",
  "depth_of_field": "Depth-of-field is very good. I love the blur of the background and the leaves just about to come into focus seem to be saying something to the flower. A bit fanciful but there is a definite link between those leaves and the flower. So f/5.6 worked well here with this particular focal length.",
  "color_lighting": "The shadows are good but could have been a little softer - however, I'm glad you turned the flash off - and the faded colours are lovely and help to convey your emotional response to the flower.",
  "focus": "Lovely sharp area in the centre of the flower. I don't know the names of the anatomical parts of the flower but there are some lovely squiggly bits (!) which look like they could have been drawn and many of them look very sharply focussed as well as many of the yellow things. Sorry about the language! Anyway, overall the focus is good.",

  "general_impression": "Hi Alex, I support your effort to photograph subjects that most would find unappealing. With the proper approach, a photograph can elevate a scene of pollution in the wilderness or urban decay to something artistic and beautiful. I don't feel you have achieved that here. The scene itself is lacking something to make it pop, either more dramatic lighting or a composition that gives more emphasis to the pipeline and the water and the moss and algae growing on them. ",
  "subject_of_photo": "While I wholeheartedly agree with you that going out of one's way will often lead to a great discovery, I find the subject of this photo confusing. I am struggling to determine if this is a natural scene with a man made pipe running through it or a document of a man made object intruding on wilderness. ",
  "composition": "You composed the image very well, using the pipeline as a leading line by bringing it into the photo from the bottom right corner and extending it into the depth of the photo. I also like that you positioned the pipeline along the right hand vertical third of the composition.  ",
  "use_of_camera": "I'm not quite certain why you set the ISO at 1600 for this photo, given the bright highlights and available light. That setting is better reserved for a low light situation. You also opened up the lens to f5.6 in an apparent effort to bring up the shadow areas. I think the photo would be improved if you metered for the highlights and let the shadow areas and the tree trunks go black or nearly black. This won't harm the viewer's ability to see the pipeline, which remains the main center of interest. ",
  "depth_of_field": "For this composition, the photographer must give priority to gaining depth in the photo and shooting at a minimum of f8, but preferably with an even smaller aperture. The choice of f5.6 is simply not adequate to retain sharpness into the depth of the image. ",
  "color_lighting": "There is something about the color as seen here that is simply off. The image appears unnaturally green (although that is the predominant color in the scene) and yellow. Monochromatic scenes like this can be tricky to manage, especially in this kind of contrasty light (See comment 2 on how to improve the photo).  ",
  "focus": "It is difficult to tell from this low resolution image, but it looks like the foreground is in sharp focus with a decline in sharpness as one moves to the top of the photo. This would be consistent with the shallow depth of field that is the result of shooting at an aperture of f5.6. I also see some leaf shake on a number of the branches, which may have resulted from camera shake or wind. ",

  "general_impression": "Hi Mark,The very first thing that struck me about this image was the seeing, the stripes, and that was very effective for me, as were the variety of colors and textures within the stripes.  You might enjoy keeping an eye out for situations that would offer up similar situations, I think a group of photographs exploring the horizontally-striped landscape could develop into a really interesting body of work.  Most importantly, keep up the habit of \"looking around\", and being aware of what's going on in all directions, as you did here.  Some of my favorite images have only come my way because I've internalized the habit of looking around, and trying to be aware of what else is happening around me.  Well done.",
  "subject_of_photo": "The subject here is the abstract pattern of horizontal stripes formed by the distant landscape.  This can be, and is here, an interesting photographic subject. I'm reminded of the graphic designs of the painter Tetsuro Sawada.  This is good, mindful seeing--from your description of the situation it sounds as if you found this pattern while working a waterfall-a very different situation, and you kept your mind open to new opportunities. ",
  "composition": "The high vantage point and telephoto look create a very nice perspective here, which provides a firm foundation for this composition.  There's enough variation in the stripe heights to be interesting and dynamic. I'm not in any way a slave to the rule of thirds, but some of the stripe edges fall near those thirds and the overall result is pleasing, no matter what the so-called rules say.  You left a good stripe of room above the clouds, too.  Nicely done.Only one element really mars simplicity of the colors and textures here, and that's the open area front and center.  I don't know if shooting in a different direction would have allowed you to avoid it without creating greater distractions, I'm guessing that there was, as there usually is, little alternative.However, there is another way to deal with that area. Cropping the image from the bottom to remove it, leaving in a thinner stripe of dark green, would have two effects.  First, it would remove the distraction, putting even more emphasis on the pattern of stripes.  Second, by reframing the composition into a wider, more cinematic shape, you'd find that the panoramic shape of the image helps guide the viewer's eye back and forth horizontally, enhancing the effect of the horizontal stripes.   While the resulting image would put the horizon closer to the middle, I don't think that's a problem here, the resulting image still feels dynamic and interesting.I'll have a few comments in the final section of this review about post-processing tweaks that are particularly important if you do decide to make that crop.",
  "use_of_camera": "All perfectly handled, in this sort of sun ISO 100 was fine and a good choice, f/8 is going to provide sufficient depth-of-field, and those taken together leave you with a completely plausible handheld shutter speed. The information provided here didn't include a focal length, but it's clearly in the telephoto range.",
  "depth_of_field": "Again, f/8 is clearly a sensible choice, and this sort of image wants to be in front-to-back, complete focus.",
  "color_lighting": "Lighting here is great.  There's an old studio photography maxim, \"Front-lighting for color, side-lighting for texture, back-lighting for form\", and here what we want from the different areas of the land, sea and airscape is color, whether saturated (as it is here) or the softer tones I often see in long telephoto landscapes.  My first reaction to the color of the photograph (at least here on this monitor) was that it might be a little oversaturated, particularly the stripe of sea. However, after some experimentation I found that, on my monitor, just the slightest tweak to the white balance towards the warm (one or two points towards yellow on the LIghtroom 4 white balance slider, if you use that tool) brought a more natural looking result--I don't think the issue I was noticing was, in the end, a saturation issue at all.  ",
  "focus": "While it's difficult without a higher resolution image to evaluate critical focus, this looks clean and sharp, and f/8 should provide more than enough depth of field to hold the distant subjects in focus. ",

Take a look at the edge of the rocky mountain and you'll see how the digitisation process is causing artefacts usually as  result of poor post-processing or excessive file enlargement. If this original images was indeed a medium format shot, then I'd expect to see a pin sharp image full of detail, clarity and depth. If it's been rephotographed, you'll have lost much of this. If the oiginal 6X7 image was on film, then a quality reproduction scan could be better to retain much of the original detail. I hope I've not misunderstood your approach! The photograph, however, shows much promise and I'm sure seeing the original would cause a different overall response. I hope you've many more images like this, as there's a grandeur and filmic quality to which scenes of this type lend themselves very well.",

I'm a little confuse by your comments and camera details. You say it's a 6x7 medium format image, yet the camera used is an X70. Was it an origial print rephotographed? In which case you've unfortunately lost all the benefits of the original 6x7 format with it's quality and depth.",

  "focus": "This image has lost some of the clarity - it looks as though the file size is very small causing blocky pixellisation which makes judging focus difficult. It looks in focus looks deep and good, but the digitisation makes this difficult to judge fully.",

This shot basically works well, especially as it was probably shot \"on the go\", leaving little time to fine tune anything.  This said, I feel it's not quite there 100%, with the obvious negative factor being the burnt-out reflection area in the very centre of the image, to which the eye is immediately drawn.  This is distracting for me, and the loss of detail in that sector of the image is unfortunate.  Additionally, I would have liked to have seen a little more of the woman on the left of the image, filling out just a little more the pavement void area and adding just a little more human subject matter to the over-all composition.  This said, I can appreciate that it's not easy to balance the composition in such circumstances, and in general, I feel a good job has been done, with the moment having been captured well.",

  "general_impression": "I really like the feeling of this image.  As I mentioned earlier the warmth against the cold works so very well in this image. I will say that since you can't manipulate the scene to put objects where you want them, (on location anyway), you may want to consider different perspectives for placing your objects of interest in ways that are more pleasing from a design standpoint.  I'm referring here, in this instance, to the jumble of ice in the foreground.  ",
  "subject_of_photo": "I think that the combination of such a warm hued sunset, in an arctic setting is very appealing and, if not unique, at least different enough to pique the interest more than a standard ocean or summer sunset. This scene is interesting in that it makes me want to 'be' there.  ",
  "composition": "I think overall the photo is composed well.  I like that the moving water draws your eye into the frame and to the back of the image where the calmer waters are, and similarly the clouds in the sky seem to converge and point towards the bright area of the sunset so that a feeling of distance and depth and to some degree motion, is accomplished.  I realize that you get what you get often times when shooting landscapes, but a composition with less in the way of spring melt remnants, (the sheer number of floating ice fragments and the rather haphazard way they rest in the image, is just a little bit distracting from the overall image. I think that the water moving in the foreground is interesting on two counts: The first being that it creates a motion that gives fluidity to the image, and the second being that it seemingly flows into an area of relative calm. This creates a dichotomy of moods that some may like, and some may not.  I like it because it is visually paradoxical and I am drawn to those sorts of compositions.  ",
  "use_of_camera": "I'm thinking that the exposures are pretty good but perhaps the shutter speed, for a shot that was not on a tripod, was a bit slow.  This is a tough combination to obtain a really sharp image.  I think this combination would be perfectly fine using a tripod because the slow shutter speed.  The upside is that, as I understand it, you were using a 25mm moderate wide angle lens.  That allows you some latitude in shooting at slower shutter speeds.  But for tack sharp images. .a tripod.  :)",
  "depth_of_field": "I think that the use of a small aperture, f/11, gives a nice deep and crisp depth of field. All your elements in the composition benefit by being focused.  Landscapes with this much information, detail and texture should show it off from foreground to infinity.  I think your image accomplishes that.",
  "color_lighting": "Normally these images, with a lot of ice (which appears white to the eye) tend to have a bluish cast to them.  I don't know if you've done any color correcting to this image but this image has little to no sort of blue cast to it.  I really like the colors here as they are warm and yet reflect cold at the same time.  The sky is beautiful.  I think you might consider looking at color balance in the blue part of the sky as it seems to have a bit of a magenta cast to it. This isn't 'wrong' since sunsets and clouds during those hours often contain a magenta hue from my experience.  Sometimes though it can be a bit vexing because it shows up in prints and on the computer screen more readily than your eye tends to see it. If you find that you want to remove it, there is a 'selective color' adjustment in Photoshop that lets you remove or change the hue balance in all your major color areas.  In this case lowering the magenta percentage in the whites of the image will substantially reduce the magenta cast.  It seems counter intuitive because you'd think that you'd want to remove it from the blues or cyans in your image. But its the white parts of the sky that are actually affected more by the cast.  Go figure.",
  "focus": "I think the focus is pretty good, but perhaps just a little on the soft side. The clouds here could be a little more defined I think, and the ice a bit more sharp. I hate to comment in this area really because I don't know what the full resolution image looked like. But here there is a softness that, while it doesn't hurt the composition, or the feel of the image, might be an issue if you wanted to print this.   ",

The detail clarity is good and the eye very crisp which is important to the overall perception of clarity in the image.  Nice job overall.",
  "subject_of_photo": "Hi Linda, thanks for sharing your image with me. I like the way you've filled the frame with an otherwise fairly common bird species.  It has the look of a portrait, and as you hoped, does not come across as a standard snapshot.  :)  ",
  "composition": "There is nothing particularly dynamic about the composition of this image.  It is a straightforward presentation of a common bird, who for all intent and purposes is not involved in any compelling activity.  However his pose suggests stoic pride and that comes through nicely here.  Even thought the subject is placed directly in the middle of the frame, something most photographers avoid, I think it works here simply because it is the sole element of interest in the image and thus its acceptable for the eye to move there and stay.  I think that there is a bit of dynamic tension formed by the rather tacit diagonal line formed by the line of the bird from lower left to upper right.  ",
  "use_of_camera": "",
  "depth_of_field": "Nice depth of field.  The background is softly blurred so that the detail merges into a softly rendered pastel backdrop that nicely sets off the bird (which by the way I believe is a Jackdaw rather than a Raven).  ",

This is a very straight forward image with no particular 'story' to tell.  But in this case its not the story that is compelling, but rather the overall effect that the colors, textures, quality of light and setting have on the viewer. ",
  "subject_of_photo": "No matter how many sunrise or sunset images I see that have been taken on or near the ocean, I never tire of this theme.  Probably because its so iconic and eternal in its appeal.  In this case there is no central object or 'subject' other than a beautiful and compelling image of a sunrise on the water.  Its enough.",
  "composition": "I think the composition and perspective of this image is both pleasing and balanced.  And while it has no central dominant feature, it nonetheless contains such beautiful texture, range of subtle color, and converging lines, that it makes for an interesting and eye catching composition.  ",
  "use_of_camera": "Though this image is a bit dark, it is to be expected considering the time of day and the contrast of the rising bright sun through the early morning mist.  That will effectively shorten the shutter speed if the camera is using Aperture mode, and conversely stop down the camera if in Shutter priority mode. I think the exposure is just fine, but would brighten it up a bit in levels and exposure if I were to print it.  ",
  "depth_of_field": "The depth of field is appropriate for this image.  It is essentially an infinite DOF due to the distance of the scene from the camera, and the stated aperture of F/8.  ",
  "color_lighting": "I love the muted yet varied colors of this composition.  The sun is low enough in the horizon to act as a filter so that it did not 'blow out' in relation to the rest of the exposure. There is enough light to reveal the subtle textures of both ocean and clouds which gives much depth to this iamge.",
  "focus": "It is very difficult to tell the level of sharpness of this image.  It appears to me to be somewhat soft, but the softness to me looks more like noise reduction applied post production, or the nature of the atmosphere at the time of shooting, or simply the small resolution of this particular print.  Nonetheless I like the effect as it is soothing and more dreamy than a tack sharp image of the same scene.",

I perhaps would like to have seen it move a bit more into the center of the image, but this is just a personal and subjective preference. I think that by moving off to the right, it sort of takes ones attention from the center of the composition.  But considering that the stream runs as it does, the only way you could have done this would have been to change your point of view by moving to the left. I very much like the sloping saddle depression between the two hills which does accomplish what the curving stream doesn't, and that is, capture your attention there by appearing to funnel and showcase the background in the depression.

The still almost placid waters of the stream are a nice counterpoint to the roiling sky above. I think that their is an almost contrasty nature to the tonal range of this image.  I think what appears to be a straightforward lighting situation is not.  The sky is very dramatic and nice but there are some blown highlights in a few bright areas.  Similarly the mountains are dark in comparison, which on a print version would appear even darker. Of course if you had exposed the sky so that there were no blown areas, then of course your mountains would have been even darker.  A conundrum of sorts, but I will suggest something below that may assist in this dilemma. ",

  "general_impression": "Sharon,  I like your concept and can say that I as well have captured many an image of opportunity in my time as a photographer.  Some work, some don't.  I think in this case what your eye saw was correct and the decision to capture that moment was indeed well formed, but I think in this case the image doesn't carry your concept all the way. Here are a few ideas that you may wish to consider either in shooting a similar image, or in working with this one post process.   ",
  "subject_of_photo": "Hi Sharon.  Often times ordinary objects from life take on a more iconic and unique character when showcased in a photo as you have done here.  A photo like this often is more about the subtle story it tells and the mood it evokes in the viewer.  I think in this case the subject could be presented in a little different manner to bring it beyond a relatively innocuous photo of boots on a path.  I can see the elements you saw, and wished to capture here, but I think that there are a few areas you could consider to make the image more interesting.  ",
  "composition": "Sharon, I think the overall composition is pretty flat and static.  I like that you have attempted to provide a sense of symmetry and balance by lining up the boots by their relative height and that mechanism works okay.  But I think there is something to the composition that simply does not do your intentions justice.  The placement of the boots in the dead center of the composition I think draws the eye to them, but also lends a static and motionless sort of feel to the composition as well. Having one white pair among the other black ones provides nice contrast but I think the placement of the boots, both in juxtaposition with the group, and in the frame in general is less dynamic than an offset composition might be. I can see the curving road in the image and it provides a bit of leading line and s curve to the image but its power is diminished by the fact that the boots obscure most of the lines of the road, and thus the effect that it might have in leading the eye into the frame is substantially diminished. I think too that the background, though blurred, contains a lot of distracting detail that, for the sort of image you have taken that attempts to showcase the boots, tends to distract from the subject. I feel a bit woozy when I look at the image because it appears that you oriented your image to ensure that the boots were straight and as a result the natural horizon in the background is canted considerably.  This technique is not a bad thing but I don't think it works as well here as it would for say an edgy wedding photo of two people running on the beach and the image shot from ground up.  For such a static image as yours I think that slanting the horizon doesn't provide the dynamic pop that it would for a moving subject.  ",
  "use_of_camera": "",
  "depth_of_field": "Okay, but a bit shallow for the subject orientation I think.  See comments under focus.",
  "color_lighting": "Overall I think the colors here are a bit muted and the image duller than it needs to be. A look at your histogram will show you that the tonal range captured here runs to the shadows and mid tones with a spike and clipping of the highlights (this would be the bright white sky in the background).  This bright area is also a detractor from your main image.  ",
  "focus": "The focus here is not tack sharp. I realize you were shooting wide open and your Depth of Field correspondingly shallow, which works very well for a stacked composition where the subject has a distinct point of interest to focus on and other aspects of it fall either behind or in front of the focal point.  In this case, though your shot is slightly at an angle to your subject, it retains the feeling of a mostly lateral composition so you might expect that the line of shoes would be mostly in focus. The single black boot (4th from the left)which is mostly in focus is still a bit soft.   ",

Well done!!This works as People Photography and would also work as Art Photography but really needs to be better developed to become a striking image. It has all the potential for it! As it is the casual observer won't pay much attention to it and won't go in the though process that this provokes, because it's muddyness is not making it stand out. I believe that you should keep working on this one to improve it, it's a fine image!Call out if you need me!Cheers",

I really like the pier and believe you can do a lot of good things with it, but this is not a very good shot. I do like the Sun coming through the poles though, I really do!If in the previous shot we had several HDR trendy type of painterly result, in this one that type of approach killed what could be a reasonable shot. It's not going to be as interesting as the other but could be a good result, pleasing to look at... and for me this is a bit hard to look at.I really hope you appreciate honest and positive critique. I really want to help you and you can count on me to guide you through the process of doing the best possible HDR photography.",

This is always personal and all I can do is give you my opinion on this. The end result is good and appealing but strikes me as a bit artificial, because the statue is much more lit than the sky and the clouds are very dark, with no indication that there might be an opening for this light to come in. I like how it looks, it's not too overdone, it's reasonably balanced, but it's not very realistic. For me looks more like an illustration though a very good one. I have to say this again, a very good illustration William! As a photograph, putting this issue apart, I like it a lot, it's really nicely done. The composition is a bit tight on the bottom but I like it.Having said this, I have to insist that you have a really eye catchy image here, it really grabs my attention and begs for more, that is...

  "general_impression": "Jennifer.  This is a pleasing image with a good potential to be better I think. All the elements of a printable photo are here and, honestly, even if printed as is would look pretty good should you decide you wanted to present it.  However there are some things you can do in post processing that I think might add to this image much more drama and dynamic tension.  Below are some ideas you may wish to utilize in this regard.  I use Photoshop CC and I realize you are using Photoshop Elements 9, with which I am less familiar, so to the extent that my suggestions might not use a parallel tool in your software, please don't hesitate to ask for clarification by message. ",
  "subject_of_photo": "Hi Jennifer,  Thanks for sharing your image with me.  First I'll say that plants and dew drops are always a compelling subject for us photographers and the sheer beauty of the micro universe that can be captured in the small water drop is, I think, the main attraction to us.  So in that regard it is a worthy subject on which to shoot and hone your macro skills.  I'll also say that if you do a Google Image search of 'grass and dewdrops' you will find thousands of similar images out there which sort of speaks to my earlier assertion that the subject is a compelling one.  So then for your image to truly stand out from the others there has to be something about it that is unique and, for lack of a better word, 'mystical' about it.  In this case I think it is a well presented and pleasing composition, but doesn't present as a dynamic or particularly moving piece. ",
  "composition": "The composition and perspective here is pretty good and appears comfortably balanced to the eye.  I think the composition is less powerful than it could be in that it is appears to present a little flatter than one might expect having a more static look of a horizontal orientation, despite the diagonal and nearly vertical lines of the two grass blades in the foreground. These leading lines for the most part travel from frame bottom to top and side to side off the edges. So do not, to any great degree, lead your eye into the composition. The anchor that does assist in getting lost here is the large dew drop placed almost center frame.  I do however, like the way the blades cross overlap the large dewdrop, as this provides a modicum of motion and dynamism and  also creates a sense of depth that wouldn't be as obvious otherwise. I think one reason for the feeling that the motion in the image moves primarily horizontally is that the capture is a landscape orientation, which is not a bad thing, but I think in this case you could have increased the power of the image by using perhaps a horizontal composition when you captured the image.  ",
  "use_of_camera": "I'm not sure what lens you were using here.  I know Sony makes a 30mm macro lens with a 2.8 maximum aperture for this camera, but the specs weren't listed so I can't comment as to whether you could have opened up a stop and thus been able to use a faster shutter speed. I like that you used 100 ISO to ensure the best quality, lowest noise capture you could.  However, in low light situations it does force you to shoot a little slower and more wide open.  If you're hand holding this can create shake and movement issues. As a result, any improvements that need to be accomplished to 'pop' the image can easily be accomplished in post processing.    ",
  "depth_of_field": "",
  "color_lighting": "I like the colors and lighting in this image.  I do believe however that the overall tonality of the image presents rather flatly and canted towards the mid tone values.  As a result the image, while obviously in looking at the histogram contains a very large range of tonal values, nonetheless could benefit from some additional contrast and saturation or vibrance. Overall the exposures look good, and there are no hot spots or blocked shadow areas resulting from too long or too short an exposure time.    ",
  "focus": "I think the focus is pretty good considering you were hand holding your camera for a macro shot. I would call this a little soft, but acceptably sharp, but not tack sharp as would benefit a close up image.  Since detail is what you seek in a macro shot, its always best to try to maximize your focus particulary on the detail elements like water droplets and the grass texture and edge.  ",

  "general_impression": "Nina, I put 8. Sure, the pic is nice. But it must be more than that. Don't get me wrong, I like this pic, the effort and you approach is worth. If you hadn't tell that it's a biblical-like image (as YOUR aim), I should have been less hard in the critic (but the image would have been less interesting as a challenge). But your pic must say something. You added some things that voided the meaning (vignette, approximative Dof, etc.). If I was you, I would take the original image back, and re-work it. I always say that, in almost every critic because, people take good basic pics and wrecks them in post processing. You surely won't be happy of the critic note but you'll be wrong. It's my own opininon and is worth only for that. Not much. But please (and not you only) : DON'T MESS YOUR WORK WITH BAD POST TREATMENT !",

Biblical (or evanescent, dreamy, etc.) feel it has. But let's dig a bit more. Because IMHO something's missing (it's a critic, is it ?). Remember that \"biblical\" means clear \"meaning\", easy-to-read \"symbols\".",
  "composition": "Depending on what your pic should mean, it must be the right compo and persp. Maybe a wider frame and different vertical angle should have enhanced a more specific meaning in giving more visibility to background elements. 20-30mm and any WA focal changes dramatically the aspect if taken 10-20 or 30 centimeters higher or lower. But let's take it as it is : the woman only. Avoid \"slighlty\" cutting feet and clothes. Or cut'em frankly so it doesn't look like a framing mistake. 8 cos' the feet and clothes.",
  "use_of_camera": "... but what's the use of F5.6 (my following remark is only valid if your lens could go to F4 or 2.8) ? Biblical aspect is based on extreme ans symbolic view. No half-baked things. I mean, instead of getting a post treated blur effect, you can get it (or improve it) with a smaller F.

  "general_impression": "I mentioned my general impression at the top, that you have a great subject here that needs more exploring with wide angle, telephoto, and changes in position, if this is a location you can return to. Also, different sky conditions will give a different perception and mood to this bridge. A clear sky versus overcast versus fog/mist (if you get those conditions where you are). You did a pretty good job with the exposure and a good start on your composition.",
  "subject_of_photo": "Hi Michael, I'm with you on enjoying making these kinds of photos. With the right subject and conditions, the results can be spectacular. I like the subject you've chosen, the lines of the bridge are very nice, compliment the shapes of the clouds, and add some shape contrast to the straight horizon, bridge deck and vertical support cables. See my suggestions about composition below.",
  "composition": "You've got a good concept going here but I don't think you've fully explored the possibilities. The main elements here, in my opinion, are the bridge, the sky and clouds, and the reflection in the water. A visual improvement for this image would be to crop the lower 1/4, just above the lower left light point reflection. There's nothing down there (no detail or color or related element[s]) that adds to the elements I mentioned and removing it will help draw the viewer's attention back up to the more interesting bits.A different point of view which would include more of the bridge on the left side, adding more of the curves, would be interesting. You've used a wide angle lens, which is fine, though for that focal length (10mm) I would suggest trying to point the lens to the sky. You could \"crop\" the darker portion of this scene in camera by tilting the camera upward to get more of the interesting sky.I also see the opportunity for a longer focal length (200 - 300mm), particularly in the center supports and those multiple \"X\"s and downward curve, as a vertical composition with reflection and sky. The bell-curve of the arch against the sky would also make an interesting long lens composition (horizontal or vertical).If you could get a person or two or three (odd numbers seem to work best) to stand out there silhouetted against the sky it would add scale and human interest, as an option.I don't know the access points of this location, but other angles would be worth exploring as well.",
  "use_of_camera": "Your exposure is very good for the sky and your shutter speed is appropriate for the subject. I don't know if you used a tripod, but in this case a 1/40 second shutter speed would be fast enough to hand hold with that focal length. One thing you could try if your camera is on a tripod is to shoot a second exposure for the shadows, to bring in a little detail in the bridge and shoreline. then blend the two exposures together using a layer mask or in some situations a blending mode like overlay or screen (you might also need a layer mask to clean up some under or overexposed areas).",
  "depth_of_field": "Depth of field is appropriate for this subject. You could play around with shallower depth of field using a larger aperture, but with a wide angle lens and a distant subject you won't really get much change.",
  "color_lighting": "You're relying on Mother Nature to provide the color and lighting in this shot and she didn't disappoint. No additional lighting was used.",
  "focus": "Your focus is good and sharp",
  "description": "not quit sure what I am trying to convey in this shot I just love taking shots of this bridge at different times of the day.....it just appeals to me",

  "general_impression": "Dear Elizabeth, this image is too empty. It looks more like a long exposure test of your camera than the real photo. It could have potential if circumstances were a bit less foggy so we could at least see some silhouettes of something behind. This way it almost looks like you filled the frame with brownish colour and put this boat (cut from somewhere else) into it. But you know how to take long exposures technically and that's a good sign! ",
  "subject_of_photo": "Subject could be interesting BUT absolutely depending on the circumstances around it. Foreground, background and overall atmosphere. ",
  "composition": "Since we don't have much of anything going on in this shot except this boat it's a little hard to talk about composition. We have nothing here to make a reference to this subject composition wise. We have some light in the fog to the upper right and other boat sitting on the top of the \"main\" one. If there were 2 or 3 more boats in front of the main one, creating a diagonal line towards the last one and leading the eye into the shot, it would probably be more interesting than this. We have no reference of scale in the space for this subject. ",
  "use_of_camera": "Subject is exposed good and I guess it's because of \"auto\" features (AE). Camera choose the shutter speed. Okay, you opened the aperture all the way but I would like to see how would you execute this shot manually. I think that whites (boat) are a bit overexposed.",
  "depth_of_field": "Aperture of 1.4 makes DOF in this shot very shallow. In this case when the most of the frame is empty and textureless you don't loose much, so DOF is okay.",
  "color_lighting": "I don't like the colour tone of this image. It's too muddy, too brownish for my taste. I guess it's also because of the hotel lights which were (I presume) tungsten. Auto WB is not a good choice in this case, since it accentuated this tone even more.",
  "focus": "Well, looking at this low res image, focus looks almost \"in focus\", but knowing that water is restless even when it's calm, a 5 second exposure makes it almost impossible to have the subject in focus because of the subject moving on water. Obviously, the movement was not big so it came out acceptably sharp (at low res).",

The gesture of the fingers on the lips. I'm not sure about the dandelion as to whether or not it's being used (by you the photographer) in an expressive and interpretive manner, thats to say (or ask) does it represent as the nail polish may, the post bloom or loss of innocence (or perhaps the impending loss of innocence when all the seeds are blown away, or maybe the fact that through the passage of time we can't hold on to our children as they will float away like dandelion seeds.)   If you aren't already familiar with the following photographers, I suggest that you look at their work (take their books out from a library and or do in image internet search); Sally Mann (her early work), Keith Carter, Debbie Flemming Caffrey, as well as many others as they would be a good starting point. These photographers while generally of a southern genre, explore childhood, discovery, innocence (and or loss of), and express it in an artistic manner. ",

  "color_lighting": "this is the only area that I'm having a bit of an issue with, on my screen which is calibrated, the image has a slight bit of a green blue cast, while with this composition, one doesn't necessarily need to flatter the subject, I'm still a bit put off by the color. On the other hand though, if you have a convincing reason you chose to show the image with this color cast, I'd be open to listening and possibly convinced.",

You've captured the colours brilliantly, they fit in well with the outlines of the trees, the sun in the bottom balances perfectly with the blue empty space in the right side of the sky (well done for that!). Sunsets and nature in general is awe inspiring when live and this is usually difficult to portray in a photo but I think you did a very good job. So why the 5 for general impression? Well, my problem with landscapes and sunsets is that generally if you've seen one, you've seen them all. Technically speaking your photo is as close to perfect as you can get (from what I can tell at this resolution) but aside from that there is nothing to hold my interest as a viewer. It is one more sunset amongst many sunsets and I wouldn't look at it for more than a few seconds. And that's fine if that's what you were going for. But if you wanted to express something then think about it a bit more and try to add personality to your image.",

In the point of view of your effort this is not so bad, because the situation is really difficult to handle and you're not supposed to be able to do that at this level of experience, nevertheless, this is a problem that must be avoided because it damages the final result of what is a very nice image.Thanks for trusting that I can help you better your skills!Cheers",

I know this is a very hard subject to shoot & you have very little time to capture it. But in post processing you can cropp closer and put the subject off center. I took your photo & put it in my photo shop, and just with the cropping tool I made 4 different shots from your one shot.

There is a lot of stuff going on inside this composition and the objects contained within it have great potential for creating a number of stories.  I like that there is no dominant subject but that the composite of all the components create a cohesive scene that work well together.",
  "composition": "I like the meandering nature of the lines leading in from the leftmost portion of the frame, curve around behind the windmills and then repeat their shape on the right upper third of the image. Add to this the bright sun and its reflection in the water as a repeating form, as well as the repeating pattern of the three windmills diminishing into a vanishing point. I like the solitary man figure walking along the road as it leads in from the left hand frame as well.  I'm not as pleased, visually speaking, with the placement of the boat. I would have liked to have seen more of the side of the boat and less of the rear end as the shape of the hull would have been, I think, more appealing than the little square bridge area. But then, you didn't park it there and you have to work with what you get.",

Again, you have picked a difficult exposure situation.  But it shows me your eye sees the potential of the image.  The image benefits from a slow exposure speed of 1/40th of a second which allows for a lot of darker areas to show detail, or to have it brought out in post processing.  I really like the subtle peach colored glow in the water, just below the reflected sun. ",

It can be done, but usually the saturation gets so cranked up it contributes to the unnatural look. The reason it is subjective is because some people like the look. The reason I don't like it is because I know it did not look that way. The human eye can see vast ranges of luminosity - sans the overly saturated look, and that is what I prefer.",

It's a girl full of light inside from a great day. We can very clearly see that.But it's not just the look and the way she looks. There is a lot of movement here. The hair in the wind and maybe flying from her moving around and the tilted position of her shoulders suggesting she is not stand still. We don't see her legs and arms and still it feels like she is dancing. This is the magic thing about photography, we can say so much with so little.The exposure in this works and everything in general works but there is an area in the sky that is maybe a bit too bright. Nothing you can solve in post-production, I'm sure.

As I have said later in the critique, the only thing that you should consider is the composition which is vital in a shot like this. Like I said though, overall a great shot which was a pleasure to review. If you want to ask anything particular about my feedback, remember you can contact me via the messenger service. Kind regardsKen ",

  "general_impression": "Impressive photograph of the bird as it landed on the handlers fist.  Not an easy photograph to take - and any faults are small - which may have as much to do with the physical limitations of the camera and lens used, not the ability of the photographer.  The photographer was in the right place at the right time and framed the shot well - and probably with a high quality camera and lens combination would have produced an even more interesting image.",
  "subject_of_photo": "Assuming that the subject is the head and body of the bird, you obviously captured what you wanted.  If it was the whole bird, you didn't - so I am going for just the partial shot.",
  "composition": "If you had framed the shot to concentrate the face and body of the bird - it was good, with the birt looking almost directly at the photographer.  There is enough information for the viewer to understand this is a trained bird, without it being too obvious and the way that the background and foreground are seperated works well.",
  "use_of_camera": "Linked to the Focus issue - I am not sure if the slight blur is the camera / lens not being perfect, movement of the bird or movement of the camera.  I appreciate this may seem to be nit-picking, but it may be an idea to test the sharpness of your lens/camera by shooting some fine detail using a tripod, before you start to get too worried about anything else.  But we are looking for perfection, which is not always possible for reasons outside of our controll.  If the camera and lens can focus perfectly, it may be that the shutter speed either needed to be a fraction faster, to avoid movement blur - or you needed a slightly smaller apature to give a wider depth of field (but still blur the background)",
  "depth_of_field": "Good depth of field - nice blur in the back ground, but not full marks because of the slight fuzzyness of the bird itself.",
  "color_lighting": "As far as I can see, the lighting and colour are OK - although for noon, the lighting seems quite subdued.  Has the image been photoshopped at all ?  Just wondering because of the back-light that almost seem to appear on the wing-feathers and shoulder of the bird's handler.",
  "focus": "Focus - at least on what I am looking at - is not super sharp.  It would have been nice to see the face and eyes in sharp focus at least.  I am not sure if this is due to the bird moving, or if the focus, itself is a bit \"Soft\".  It is nice that you have used the depth of field to blur the background ",

To think people carved their homes into this landscape is amazing, but then to understand they did it as a form of protection is even more amazing.  I am a purest in that I want to see the photographer controlling as many aspects of the image as they can.  By this I mean that I want the photographer to avoid using \"automatic\" settings (a computer is doing the work) and choose the manual settings in which they control the creation of their images.  Anyone can use a camera on \"automatic\" but to learn your trade and title I feel a photographer should work on manual settings.  This way you create the image instead of a computer doing it for you.",
  "subject_of_photo": "This is an very nice image.  My one wish is that you could have captured it when there was more sun on the houses.  With them (the houses) being in the shade it diminishes the overall effect of the image by allowing the houses to \"disappear\" into the shade.  At first glance you don't notice the houses.  This is caused by two factors.  First because of the shear size of the cliff (which was your intent to show) in comparison to the size of the houses and secondly because of the shadows encompassing the houses.  Nice job, with minor adjustments I could see this hanging in someone's home.",
  "composition": "I like the composition and perspective of this image.  The only way to improve the image in my opinion would be for you to have been closer to the houses and perhaps show a little less of the cliff face.  If you could have gotten closer to the houses or maybe just crop the left side and bottom of the image this would still show the perspective you desire and allow the houses a more prominent role in the image.",
  "use_of_camera": "I would like to see you start choosing the F-stop and shutter speed for images you produce.  In this case you were on full automatic which means all you did was compose the image and push the shutter button.  If you had use manual mode you would have metered the image and you could have chosen to go with a slower shutter speed (1/250th or 1/125th) and a smaller aperture (F5.6 or F8) which would have giving you more depth of field.  I know this takes a little more time but in the long run you will have more self satisfaction and pride in the images.",

  "color_lighting": "The sun is a great light source when utilized properly.  In this case I would have liked to see more sunlight on the houses since they were a integral part of the image.

  "focus": "The entire image appears to be soft on the computer screen but when I viewed it in full size on my screen it is sharper than I first thought.  In this case the focus is an easy fix by simply using the Unsharp Mask Filter to slightly sharpen this image.  Here is a link to an Adobe help page on how to use the USM filter.  I am not entirely sure it is available in your version (7.0) of Elements but you can find out by reading the information posted on this link.http://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop-elements/using/sharpening.html",

Possibly taking a step to your right would have shown the woman on the rights complete arm and tidied things up a little, but its only a minor point. The electric cables are also a little distracting, but this could easily be removed in Photoshop.",

Unfortunately composition is on it's way to be good, colours and lighting are flat and unexpressive. Focus is not on the subject, it is somewhere to the left I mean we talk about a rose here. Rose colour should pop right in your eyes! As I said many times here, it's not enough to shoot the scene and leave it like that (mostly). Cameras are dumb, they don't see the world like our eyes see it, so don't be afraid to make the scene look closer to what you remember it was like!",

  "general_impression": "Hi Colin,There is something I really like about this photograph. We can't see the floor boards of the peer and this creates an illusion that the peer is after all just a very thin structure. And then we look down and we find the pillars on both sides of the peer showing us that it is actually a wide structure we can walk on. And then we go back to the top and see the thin structure again. Amazing result here!This can be beginners luck but for me there is a lot here that shows to me that it is not all just beginners luck. There is care and attention, even if not to every detail. You really have it in you and you should actively pursue photography, more and more, to develop your abilities.Count on me to help when ever you feel the need!Cheers",

  "general_impression": "Hi Mary,  As I mentioned above.  The subject here is a worthy one to shoot and I can imagine your excitement at having seen it and trying to capture its allure.  I think there are a few things that mitigate against this being a great capture. My thoughts are as follows.",
  "subject_of_photo": "I think this is a worthy and interesting travel photo.  I can see why you shot this image.  I do think however that there are a few issues with the image that makes it difficult to put in the 'artful' category.  It is obvious that this is a picturesque village but it seems to be greatly subsumed by its environment and is thus sort of swallowed.",
  "composition": "I think that from your vantage point, this is probably about the best composition you could have gotten.  The village is very impressive but it appears lost and small in the setting and from the distance you were shooting from. There are no strong leading lines anywhere and thus little movement into the frame.  There is a feeling of flatness to the image that looks a bit like a photo on an informational brochure. The diagonal line of the mountain slope in the background with the segment of sky, demands more attention unfortunately than the town itself I think. ",
  "use_of_camera": "I think the settings used work fine for the photo and technically it is exposed well.  I think that since you had access to a telephoto focal length of up to 120mm, I think it might have worked better to fill the frame up a bit more with the town as it is the most interesting part of the environment, and find some interesting patterns there.  This is related more to the section on composition and perspective I know, but I'm talking about it here because it has to do with your camera settings . ie. . your lens.  ",
  "depth_of_field": "",
  "color_lighting": "I like the way the town is illuminated.  The shadows are not confusing within the structures and this is often the case with slanting light on so many surface areas and angles.  Again I'll say that I don't think there is anything particularly wrong with this image, particularly the colors, but nonetheless my reaction isn't to revel in the marvel of the architecture but instead feel as if I'm not seeing the image as well as I could and the colors here don't create a lot of contrast, depth or drama for me.  I wonder how this would have looked shot at closer to sunset?    ",

  "subject_of_photo": "This is the perfect representation of what I call envinronment portrait, which is showing the subject in his own world, in this case the gym.No frills, straight to the point, you totally managed to get the right look for this kind of portrait.",
  "composition": "This composition respects all the \"rules\" that make a picture a well balanced one, in this case the rule of the thirds and a subject popping out of the background thanks to the different lighting and hue.Also very well done having the frame perfectly straight and using the lines created by the windows, corners and gym tools create some sort of depth and help focusing on the main subject of the picture.",
  "use_of_camera": "Looking at the settings you used, apparently you let the camera decide itself which are the best settings for the picture.In this case the camera did a pretty good job, even if there is a slight problem of overexposure on the arm on the window's side.You did a great job on composition and if you're starting with photography now I think you're right about focusing on the composition first and going with the camera settings later.",
  "depth_of_field": "In this particular case depth of field is created more by the shape of the room itself and the color difference between the foreground subject and the wall, but to enhance this effect even more you could tweek the shot with manual settings working with the \"real\" depth of field, meaning what is in focus and what not, which means using the aperture settings.",
  "color_lighting": "I really love the light in this picture, especially the rim light on the right side of the picture, it greatly helps getting a three-dimentional look and make the subject pop out the background so well.It is also particularly important in this kind of shot where I think your main aim should be enphasizing the muscles of the subject, at least that's surely what any body builder would look for.",
  "focus": "From what I can see from the low resolution picture the focus seems good, can't be 100% sure about that, but since you used the camera in auto mode with such a well lit subject I doubt it failed.",

  "general_impression": "Hi Jose.  Again, I'm a big fan of the subject you've chosen here, and the primary composition.  They're really effective together here, and leave me wishing I could see a big print of the piece, and enjoy the intricate bridge detail.  Well seen!I also enjoy the quiet mood of the piece.  The colors and textures are not exaggerated with post-processing, and are cool and natural.  I might have been tempted (as I mentioned above) to a very slightly warmer rendition, but the coolness befits the peaceful tone of the piece. Keep up the great work!  And thank you for selecting me to review your image.  ",
  "subject_of_photo": "A really lovely bridge arch, with interesting textures and colors on the bridge itself, in the moss, lichen, foliage, and even the water. It reminds me of one of the bridges in Glacier National Park, near Sunrift Gorge.  (I have to admit--I'm curious if it is, I've always loved that bridge, but there are probably others like it.)  The bridge arch is rendered at a good size, and the emphasis is about right.  I wish the image could have included more of the water, however.",
  "composition": "The perspective is generally good, the strong diagonals from the bottom-left to the upper-right of the water and rocks on the far side work nicely with the shape of the arch.However, there are a few distractions in the shot around the edges. Individually minor, each does give my eye an excuse to pull away a bit from the primary subject matter.  The biggest distraction is probably the rock in the lower-right corner, which pulls the eye away in part because of its brightness, our eyes are naturally attracted to brighter elements in a scene.  But the chain, to some extent the warm wet rock in the river along the bottom edge, and perhaps the stairstep stones in the upper right can be distracting--I do sort of like the latter.  There is something about objects just at the edge of a frame that makes them particularly able to create a bit of distraction. This is probably one of the things I like best about using a tripod, it gives me a little more time to examine the edges for distractions while I'm composing.  I'm guessing you used one too, the image is sharp, beyond my ability to handhold at a sixth of a second. It is possible that a very slight crop of the bottom of the image could eliminate the rock and reduce the distractions in the bottom right.  One could also come in a bit from the right, but that starts cutting up the drain, I'm not sure that by itself would help.  I won't suggest trying to remove them with Photoshop. Before the shot was taken, it is possible that a slightly different position would have helped avoid this, but it may not have been (safely) possible, and every movement changes the relationship of other elements in the picture--it's difficult for me to tell what alternatives were possible without being on the ground there myself.  What I would have been looking for, in alternatives positions, is keeping the full arch and the basic diagonal of the water, and seeing if it were possible to get more water (the color of which is quite nice) while orchestrating any distracting elements off the edges. ",
  "use_of_camera": "ISO, shutter speed, aperture are well-judged.  The rendering of the water is natural, which I like for this image better than the very smooth result a very long exposure might have created.",
  "depth_of_field": "Sharp front to back (perhaps except for that rock lower-right, hard to tell, but I'd prefer him gone anyway.)",
  "color_lighting": "The light is cool and soft, probably an overcast day, which is a good choice for bringing out colors in subjects like this.  Direct sunlight would have left a larger range between the lighter and darker areas of the image, leaving either some areas too bright (and washed out in terms of color saturation), or too dark (and again, robbed of saturation.)Softer light can be harder on keeping a sense of texture, but that doesn't seem to be a problem here, the crisp edges of the stone still help to create a sense of depth and clarity.Some photographers might find this image a bit too cool, that's a creative choice. Since you are shooting without doing much post-processing on the output, and since you are interested in color, I'll point out that the feel of colors in a scene like this, how saturated they appear, can sometimes be surprisingly affected by minor adjustments in white balance.  Many colors, including the greens and a few bits of orange here, can feel a bit weaker with cooler white balances--a sunrise ",

Well done!",
  "subject_of_photo": "I love the subject and the reason behind it.",
  "composition": "Perspective is spot on. Composition is a little off. I agree with leaving the space on the right so we can follow her gaze but the background is irrelevant and of no real interest, so you do not need to include so much of it. Moving your camera a little to the left and perhaps even opening your frame a little to include a tad more of her features would better balance your image and subject.",
  "use_of_camera": "Judging from the light on the right side of her face I would guess that you have a quite ample source of natural light coming in. In this instance and from the angle that it is originating it would light only half her face, creating shadows and deep contrast, really bringing out her character. With your current ISO of 400 you could easily drop the speed if it was not sufficient without sacrificing image clarity. Even better if your ISO on your camera model is not too destructive you could turn the shot to black & white (see below) and the ISO up to 800. This would give a well suited grainy effect. Also if you opened your aperture as much as possible (see below) it would allow you to shoot using only natural light. Next time try to shoot in manual and without flash and see what result you can get.",
  "depth_of_field": "Since your lens allows it I would have given the image as much depth as possible. In this instance moving closer while widening your lens to 50mm would have allowed you to use the f3.5 that your lens is capable of. This would have also allowed you to focus more on her eyes and really emphasise her look.",
  "color_lighting": "I do not agree with the choice of direct flash for this image. As I said above it seems you have a quite ample natural light source but more so a natural light source that, given your use of flash, invades your image rather than tying in with it. Flash light can work well with natural light but not in this instance. Here the flash flattens the image and steals from the intensity created by the subject and her look. For the settings under which it was shot the colour is ok but again if you did not use the flash you could have shot this image in black & white. As it is now you could convert it into B&W and adjust the Levels and Shadows/Highlights to bring out the years and experience that her face portrays.",

Choosing a subject like this bee on a flower means that didn't stop you, with a very atmospheric image as a result; well done !",
  "composition": "This image has the look and feel of a studio shot, but I can't make that out from the details you provided. Without any disturbing elements in the foreground or background, the flower and the bee really are the center of attention. Judging from the original size you cropped this from a larger image and decided to place the flower in the horizontal and vertical centre of frame, with the stem of the flower disappearing into the lower right corner of frame. A solid choice, leaving enough room tot the left of the bee. The dark area above the flower doesn't really add to the overall \"feel\" of the image for me, my personal taste would be to crop it just above the petal.",
  "use_of_camera": "Judging from the image size you cropped this from a larger image. Although it's not really disturbing looking at the whole image, there's quite a bit of color noise / grain noticeable when examining the image up close,  particularly in the stem in the bottom right of frame. You really pushed the camera you used to its limits here, but looking at the whole image, it doesn't show, which is a good thing !",

The overall image looks slightly yellow in color, which isn't a bad thing as such, but it does give the image a more \"artificial\" look color / lighting wise. My personal preference would be a slightly brighter / lighter image, maybe just half a stop, with a bit more contrast, but that's largely personal taste. The color and lighting do give the image an intriguing \"feel\" overall. ",

I've tried to give a couple of ideas of things you might try next time. I'm not sure if the darkened corners are from spotlighting inside the arena, or from an edited vignette...either way I'm not keen on it. I hope you find the following useful. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions about the review via the messaging service.RegardsKen McKillop",

The whole image works because it can be seen differently:  first I saw the fish, then the blocks of color, then my imagination started seeing stars and galaxies.  You have a good concept and firm vision in mind, now experiment with more blur by slowing the shutter even more.   Stay creative and work at it.  Sometimes it is luck, but most of the time a great shot is planned and is the result of much experimentation. ",
  "subject_of_photo": "From your description it seems you intended this photo to be more of an abstract with implied motion than a portrait type image.  Great creative idea and effort.",
  "composition": "Good abstract concept, good symmetry to the fish cluster with a few interesting individuals in the corners and edges to make your eye go all around the picture.  The yellow fish on the right is distracting since the color is our of the three tone (black, white, orange) pallet of the image.  You can color fill it in post production to better match the others (or ask the fish not to come to the next photo shoot!  :) )  Harmonious abstract feeling here.",
  "use_of_camera": "The frenzy might have been more dramatic with a little more blur - an even longer shutter.  This would add alot more motion blur effect (you can also do this selectively in Photoshop with the image as is - go crazy!) .  The effect on the sun reflections might not be desirable though, depends on the artistic vision. They might also take on a really nice swirling galaxy effect.  The overall effect would be softer like the images you see of streams and waterfalls.   Experiment with your settings ! ",
  "depth_of_field": "This is not  so much of an issue for this composition.  The even tone black background is good the for composition and is not distracting. ",
  "color_lighting": "Colors are nice and bright and the water an even black which works for your intended composition.  The oranges might be a bit hot for some tastes.  During the shoot you should try to step the aperture down 1 stop  to see what it does to the colors and decide what you like best.   Of course the desaturate controls on the orange/yellow/red channels in post production can fine tune this to your liking as well.   The light reflections would have been death to a still life shot, but here they add a nice starry sky effect to the composition.  The only ones that bother me are the ones at the top that have taking on a starburst look.  See how changing the f-shop effects these in multiple exposures.  You can also eliminate them in post production. ",
  "focus": "Since I believe the intension here was to have motion blur,  the lack of focus is correct for the abstract nature of the photo.  To my taste, it should be a bit more blurred.  The fish on the bottom have the right effect, but the ones in the center could use more blur. ",

I particularly liked that you caught the scene with a light dusting of snow which adds to the peaceful and tranquil feel of it.  Here are some thoughts to consider for this image.",
  "subject_of_photo": "Another nice image Mary. The area of Lake Louise and vicinity is stunning in its photographic potential. I don't think this one is as compelling as your first image simply because the elements are less dramatic.  But it is nonetheless an interesting and beautiful nature study.  ",
  "composition": "I think the composition is very good and solid.  It has a strong leading line from bottom left to the center middle portion of the composition that takes the viewer on a trip up the stream and into the treeline and distance. The gentle curve of the stream edges is countered by the moderately chaotic motion of the water swirling in the foreground.  I like this dichotomy. I do feel as if I'd like to see something in the foreground, possibly on the lower left frame area for stability and reference.",

I think the lighting here is for the most part good, but I think does not showcase the blue and aqua of the water as much as it could. Also I think there are some very nice hues and colors in the foliage near the water edge and treeline that are hiding in the shadows.  Your shadows aren't blocked but I think they could be brought out more in post processing.  Similarly there are some bright areas in the water, and most noticeably in the sky behind the trees that has the effect of making the scene appear as if it blooms and washes out at the horizon.",

The problem seems to be that you did not use a DSLR , the qualities that are poor and need to be improved are due to camera quality & not the photographer (you). If you really love photography I would suggest investing in a camera that you can have more control over. One where you can control the focus, aperature, shutter speed and ISO.. One where you can select auto or manual is also a good idea. These days you can buy a fair - good DSLR , used or new , for a very reasonable price.",

The color is very interesting, it almost has a post processing (HDR) look. it is on the \"high contrast\" side, but I actually like it.",

Joining a camera club is a good idea members general help beginners to improve their photography, enjoy your photography and it will move along in leaps and bounds Cliff Norton   Couple of picture taking points for future: 1: Use your zoom when framing an image capture take more than one frame at differant focal lengths, 2: Use your camera upright (IE Portrait framing) 3: Differant angles standing, laying down on the fall and kneeling this way you will see your subject in new and differant ways. One thing you can do is visit gallerys view painters work and photographers work in shows and build your style from there do not copy the way they work but enhance your style of photography, 4: At the picture taking stage use auto braketing setting on your camera with a settings normal exposurs under exposure by 1 stop and then under exposure 2 stops this simple tip can some times enchance your finished photograph during this type of photography also works well at sunsets 5: Never remove an image from the camera on a trip you may just remove your winning image, 5: View the differance photographs on your computer screen.

The triangular bit of architecture just behind the groom is quite disturbing and keeps pulling my eyes away from the subject matter. And the foliage behind the bride feels just a bit more distracting than it should be. I'd suggest that when an opportunity like this presents itself, even when it's staged for the camera, that you encourage the couple to keep the bond going while you shoot and keep changing perspective. It's easy enough to find fault with details in the background after the fact, but on location, you need to keep exploring the image, changing angles and approach, for as long as the mood lasts.",
  "use_of_camera": "All the bases were covered here, though a wider aperture would have given the subjects in the foreground a bit more focus snap, separating the couple more clearly from their background.

  "focus": "Your choice of a wide aperture on your zoom drops the focus out nicely in the background, but not quite enough. Without knowing more details about your lens, I'm going to guess that you might well have been at full extension on a zoom with a variable aperture and didn't have anything wider available. You clearly understand the relationship between shutter speed and aperture and deliberately went for an appropriately shallow depth of field.I'm also a bit concerned about where your focus landed on the subject matter. The critical focus appears to have landed on the leading edge of the veil instead of the couple, dropping them just a bit out of focus. Add in the bright white of the veil itself and you have one more element that's pulling attention away from the subjects.",

  "general_impression": "Hello once again Leonard.  As I said in the subject area this is a good image of a squirrel.  I think you captured the mischievous nature of the little fellow quite well.  It appears to be caught between actions.  Nice capture for a creature that doesn't stay still long in any one place.  Below are a few ideas to help increase the appeal of this image.  ",
  "subject_of_photo": "Hello Leonard,  Okay. . this is a good subject, but not great. I say this not because I don't like squirrels, but because unless you live in a place where there aren't any or aren't commonly seen, there isn't any thing particularly compelling about a squirrel portrait.  I used to look for the perfect cow picture and have probably 300 shots of cows in varying poses and postures, but never quite found that one cow shot that inspired anyone, other than me.  But for a squirrel image this one is quite good. I do like the pose here as well.   ",
  "composition": "The layout of the subject and its placement and direction creates a very pleasing look I think.  I also like the subtle curve of the tail from tip to body and the way it transitions smoothly into the squirrel.  The slightly diagonal placement makes the image a bit more dynamic and creates just a hint of tension.  A straight up and down composition would not have worked as well I don't think.  I also like the center placement here.  Normally I don't, but the placement in the center adds to the sense of balance and symmetry here.  Leading lines and perspective here are less important since the presentation is straight on and flat so angle and placement here take on a greater weight in creating a pleasing composition.  ",
  "use_of_camera": "",
  "depth_of_field": "Good DOF.  Sharply in focus throughout the image. Appropriate here since there is no distant background to deal with. ",
  "color_lighting": "This image has some nice subtle tones and hues.  I particularly like the similarity of colors between the squirrel and the tree bark.  Despite the fact that it is a morning shot, it is very evenly lit suggestive of either an environment where there is cloud cover or diffusing of light through a canopy of trees.  I also like the small areas of yellow interspersed throughout the bark surrounding the squirrel. There is also a pleasing reddish hue to the squirrels fur that adds warmth to an otherwise subdued image.  ",
  "focus": "Focus looks pretty good overall.  I think the body may be a little sharper than the eyes, but if so, just minimally.  I like the fact that the fur and texture of the squirrel is defined well.  ",

However after looking at what was there in the frame and the way you composed it and put yourself at such a low angle, I began to see a lot of potential for an interesting image to emerge.  It will require some post processing work however and the following suggestions are generally along those lines.  I understand you have Photoshop but you didn't specify which version you had access to so I'll try to keep my comments regarding processing more generic and less version specific. ",

  "composition": "I think that your composition is strong. I like your point of view here, low and looking upwards.  It creates very nice, and dynamic diagonal leading lines which lead the eye nicely up into the lock and chain assembly.  The exaggerated perspective of the lock works well here to emphasize the 'locked out' secretive sort of mood you described in your narrative.  I also like the dark and light areas of the image and the balance of them within the frame.  There are some issues with your levels and shadows area general and I'll discuss this below.  ",
  "use_of_camera": "I think that the image is much too dark.  This is not a surprise considering the bright sunlight areas in the background against the white wall and the dark shadow detail of the fence and lock. I think that even with the dark shadows the white areas are still blown out and featureless which tells me that the tonal range of the image was very broad and thus difficult to capture in one shot.  I think that perhaps use of your exposure compensation feature to bring out the shadow area, or the use of the spot metering mode in your camera to take your reading off of a dark midtone area to bring out some of the dark areas of the image would have helped some here.

This places your subjects in the center in this case and also makes it obvious that your backdrop lights do not extend all the way to the horizontal margins of your frame.  I think that the poses here are pleasing and balanced. I think the subject placement is more centered than I would prefer, and they don't fill up as much frame as they could thus sacrificing some visual power and presence. ",

Overall, I think what your image represents is outstanding subject matter with an original spin on interpretation. Art can be deeply personal and is definitely subjective so take my suggestions with a grain of salt as you should follow your own conscience when a creating an image. That being said I hope will give you food for thought as well as useful technical feedback. ",

  "composition": "I looked at many compositions of this subject through Google Images and I definitely think that your perspective is as good as any of those that I saw. The only area where I think there is potential for improvement is in your focal length. I think I would prefer a slightly tighter composition at a longer focal length placing a greater emphasis on the lines and details of the abbey with less foreground grass and less sky above the ruin. ",
  "use_of_camera": "My gut feeling on this shot is that it looks underexposed. It appears that is has been digitally manipulated quite a bit, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. What I specifically mean is that you've pushed the pixels as far as you can before you start to seriously degrade the quality of the file. The reason that I can tell this is because there is both noise and rasterization in the sky and edges of the image. You did not include any technical details so I can't provide you with as much helpful technical feedback as I normally do. ",
  "depth_of_field": "Difficult to tell because there aren't a lot of layers of depth. Everything looks acceptably clear to me. ",
  "color_lighting": "Overall, I like the color, especially the level of saturation that you chose for the scene. I think it is just on the edge of being too much, but it's a line that you did not cross. The reason I can tell this is by looking at the light and medium toned neutral tones in the stones - they are starting to pick up a bit of cyan, which is a clear indicator of saturation level. I also really like the color of the grass - the greens look great - fully saturated, but not overly so. The side lighting in the image is also excellent. You definitely captured some wonderful light. What I am not so fond about is the magenta color of the light source - it looks unnaturally foreign to me. Overall, the scene is on the cool side of color temperature and I think there are parts that could be selectively warmed up. More on this in suggestions...",

I think it is often good to have 'negative' space in an image, which can lend a sense of movement to the actual subject.

Also I feel that the cropping is too tight as you have lost a small part of the flower at the bottom edge of the photo. ",

It's often a compromise with a shot like this so overall I think you have done a good job.",

  "subject_of_photo": "Always an interesting subject! Good eye for a photo and quick response to capture the moment! Well done!",
  "composition": "Your perspective is fine. Your composition is ok but your post processing stole from it instead of adding. The sepia tone actually works well with the photo (even though I'm not a big fan of sepia over B&W) but you've added a white border with a drop shadow and then a brown frame which just kills the image! I am not against white borders (especially in this case as it adds to the authentic feel of the image, minus the dropshadow of course) but a frame on top of that is just tacky, and pulls unnecessary focus. If you were to do anything else in post I would suggest cropping the image to the medium format sizes of 6x6 or 6x4.5. It would focus your subjects better and add even more of that vintage feel that you're trying to achieve with the sepia.",
  "use_of_camera": "Good, although under the circumstances cranking your ISO up to 800 and then adjusting your speed to avoid the burn might have worked better. Along with the sepia it would give a nice grainy feel to the image and again add to the vintage style.",

When imitating vintage you have to remember that in those days photography was full of \"imperfections\" that somehow managed to make the images come alive.

I suppose back in those days they'd probably complain and wonder how long it would take for technology to advance so that they could have a crisp image!",

Since the subject is clearly so dear and near to your heart, I suggest you spear no effort in making some great images of this lovely baby.  You will be both happy about it many years from now.

For more radical means of improving the lighting, contact me by email and I will be glad to discuss details.",

  "general_impression": "Hello Cyndy. This is a pretty nice image.  I like the creative approach you have taken in its presentation.  I have no idea what your camera settings were or I would have commented more about that, and I also don't know if you have access to a post processing software program that you can employ to make some of the changes I will suggest below. Below are a few ideas you may wish to consider. ",
  "subject_of_photo": "Cyndy, I like what you have attempted here.  Reflections of trees in the water are compelling images oft times, and also flipping the orientation vertically to present it in a more enigmatic way can also be an effective tool to capture attention of the viewer.  Here I think this doesn't work as well as it could.",
  "composition": "I think the overall image, relative to balance, symmetry, and cohesiveness are good.  I am not sure that the choice to flip the image vertically works as well as it might have. There are a couple of issues that I see that fight against this method of presentation.  One can be remedied in post processing, but the other is such an embedded element in your photo that it works against what you have tried to do.  The first is the light branches that extend into your composition from the upper part of the frame. These can be removed however via post processing.  The other issue as I see it is the large blob of ice that, when placed in the upper part of the composition is no longer recognizable as art but looks like a flaw in the image, damage of some sort, or a stain of some sort that distracts the eye from the symmetry I think you wanted to preserve.  Sometimes an element will work to your advantage by creating interesting dissonance, but in this case it simply looks like a blemish.  Its interesting that when the image is returned to its normal orientation, that area immediately becomes recognizable as lake ice. I think if your image did not contain the ice, your choice of flipping the orientation would have worked fairly well considering that then inverted you relegate the blown out sky area to the bottom and the darker area of water takes on a more voluminous and multi dimensional look.  I do like the shape of the vertical center tree as it curves in a rather circuitous route downwards and provides a sense of dynamic motion to an otherwise placid scene.  This is a nice compositional element.  ",

The mountains at the top are darker, blue, receding in the distance, and are perceived to be heavy. The foreground, lighter in tone but taking up nearly half the frame, offsets the visual and perceptive weight of the mountains. A centered composition keeps things from tipping one way or the other.In this image, I would prefer to see more sky with the dramatic clouds, and less of the foreground. Even cropping the bottom up to the rocks and green grass will give more emphasis on the mountains and clouds.Horizontal and vertical lines are important to keep straight. The shoreline and the island lean to the right a bit and need to be straightened.",

  "general_impression": "Hi Mary.  I like this image and I think this it has a lot going for it.  There are a lot of very nicely rendered light, contrast, and textural areas of the image, more in fact than are obvious with the treatment and post processing.  Keep in mind that my own natural inclination on photos is to enhance the light and dark areas, and brighten highlights, so that the detail is very apparent.  Your image is more along the lines of a very soft, subtle, sepia toned image.  That isn't a criticism, but gives you an idea where my suggestions will focus in bringing out some of the more subtle features of your photo based upon my eye.    ",
  "subject_of_photo": "I like this image.  I think the subject of this photo is a favorite among a lot of photographers.  Barns in snowy woods are both Iconic and touch us in a place that reminds us of of a lost and more pastoral time.  ",
  "composition": "I think the composition is very good.  The barn is framed nicely by the large foreground branch of the tree (oak?).  The tree trunk frames the composition nicely and the branch moves over and around the barn so that the eye is moved effectively into the composition.  I love the gnarled and twisted shapes that surround the barn and are carried effectively into the background brush and shrubbery. I think that this is a pretty well balanced composition.  Its difficult sometimes to find balance in a woodsy situation where there is so much in the way of brush, branches, trees and chaotic lines.",
  "use_of_camera": "I think the image is exposed quite well and is well lit throughout the image. Despite the amount of snow in the image, which often gets blown out in favor of the darker areas of the image, or, loses shadow detail in the camera's attempt to average the scene, it is exposed in a way that carries the entire tonal range of values and retains most of the highlight and shadow detail.

  "color_lighting": "I'm not crazy about the photo filter effect on this image.  I'm not sure why exactly, because it is well executed and is not over done or over saturated.  I think its because it seems a bit counter-intuitive to me. Its a cold scene in a winter setting, yet the reddish/magenta color filter suggests warmth, and thus creates sort of a dissonance for me relative to the mood it creates.  Having said that, I'll also say that the lighting of the image is very even and well done.    ",

Having said that I have to also say that, in this instance, the treatment of this subject is outstanding. Although the image is of two captive primates, there is a touching and poignant sense of humanity that comes through and enables the viewer to be moved to something akin to resonance. ",
  "composition": "I like the balance and movement of the image.  The mother is looking towards the camera, but not quite into the lens, while the baby looks, conversely, towards the right frame of the image.  I think capturing the subjects in this manner provides a much more subtle and naturalistic feel. I am reminded of the expression on the Mona Lisa when I look at the face of the mother. Enigmatic. ",
  "use_of_camera": "Considering the apparent natural low light conditions I think the exposure iso and aperture settings appropriate.  ISO 400 can sometimes yield some noisy results on some cameras but in this case I don't see any discernible areas of noise or artifacts that degrade this image. For the lighting available it was probably the best ISO and aperture to use (F8 yielding a sharper image in many cases than other stops)considering no tripod was used. ",
  "depth_of_field": "Good depth of field, although there isn't much of one to worry about considering the fact that both mother and baby are pretty much in the same plane and there is no background.  But I like the fact that both subjects are crisp and in focus.",
  "color_lighting": "I think one of this images strongest points (and it has many) is its rich yet subtle colors and its dramatic portrait like lighting. I really don't think that any substantial criticisms are in order for the choices made in these areas. But I think that perhaps a levels adjustment in Photoshop to bring out the highlight end of the curve would yield a little more detail in the shadows and reveal the interesting tufts of hair on the left side of the mothers face, as well as some selective dodging of the mid tones and highlights in the mothers eyes would make the beautiful shade of orange in them pop a little more, but these are subjective 'improvements' and the image would still be a powerful one without them.",

This is one of the best shot I've seen here on Landscape Photography or Nature Photography. I suppose this could also be Fine Art Photography, but to see it as Fine Art with me is not better, because if I put the Fine Art mind set I get more demanding. Not that Nature or Landscape Photography don't need a lot of work to because they need but Fine Art is another thing all together.To see this as Fine Art I would first need to see a group of images and not just one, because in Fine Art we need to have a concept and some sort of consistency, one image is not enough to for that. A fluke would never be fine art as much as it captures our poetic imagination, and this does do that. This consistency doesn't need to be anything specific but is needs to have conceptual legitimacy and this is something we can find within a set of references. I'll go further on this as a suggestion.So, in light of this, I don't really need to tell you that for us to develop what you have here into real art or legitimate Fine Art Photography, I need to see more! You're very welcome to come with more of this or of any other type of photography, weather it is to develop this work you started here or to start a new one or even just to keep on showing isolated subjects, that could in the end be a great work as a  whole.See you soon!Cheers",

The more you shoot the better you get.",

A square crop taking away about 2 inch's off the left looks better to me.

Having the room on one of the top floors to the right of the building really adds to this shot. If you could of had more rooms lit up, that would of added to this nice effect.",

I do not know what post processing software you have, so it is difficult to provide specific details relative to what you may do in that area to accomplish some of the post processing I might suggest.  ",
  "subject_of_photo": "This is certainly a beautiful setting John.  Lush greenery and color spots throughout is a compelling subject for both photographer and viewer alike. Such lushness of foliage and texture in one place however can be somewhat difficult to capture well.  ",
  "composition": "There is a lot going on in this scene that makes it a challenge to really get control of it well. While I like the varied patterns, textures and hues here (all very pleasing to the eye), there is somewhat of a lack of cohesiveness in the composition.  This is simply due to the melange of patterns and shapes that overlap and crowd each other and vie for attention simultaneously.  What is needed in such diversity of pattern is something to break it up and organize it like a path leading through it for instance.  In this case it is very beautiful but confusing to the eye and it is difficult to discern pattern or symmetry, a facet that the brain finds pleasing.   ",
  "use_of_camera": "I think the use of aperture priority here is good and appropriate.  The settings of 1/30 of a second at 10mm (equivalent 28mm full frame), are right about at the safe limit for hand holding a shot (the rule of thumb being that the shutter speed should match the focal length roughly. Example: 125mm lens at 125th of a second).  The only thing that I think you could have changed, since you had some latitude with your aperture, is the ISO.  At 500, it lends itself, particularly in smaller sensor sized cameras, to more noise and artifact issues.",

  "general_impression": "Hi Redd, Nice work capturing this image of the dragonfly in it's natural environment. They can be challenging subjects and they don't often hold still for long. I'm drawn to the feeling of camouflage created by how the subject blends with the background. It's a tricky balance because you don't want the subject to become lost or overwhelmed by the background. I think the potential is there, but the challenge in this image becomes the berries (in particular the red ones) which take attention away from the dragonfly. Overall a simpler background would made for a stronger image - not always something we can control out in nature, but something to strive for in future images.",
  "subject_of_photo": "The subject does not stand out well from the background because of the similarity in color between the dragonfly's body and the background. Also the wings blend with the background making it hard to easily see them.",
  "composition": "Good job filling the frame with the subject. I like how you left a little space at the top between the head and the top of the image. The viewer's eye will travel up the dragonfly's body to the head. It's good not to have the viewer's attention go right to the edge of the photo. Shooting down on the dragonfly works well, as it makes it possible to show the entire body and wings. The background is quite close to the subject which it difficult to isolate the subject from the background. In the photo description you mentioned the dragonfly landed on your hand. That suggests you placed the dragonfly on the blackberry bush. A different location on the bush may have offered a less distracting background.",
  "use_of_camera": "Image is well exposed. If it was possible to zoom in to shoot with a longer focal length (then step back to maintain the same composition) that would have helped to push the background further out of focus.",
  "depth_of_field": "The shallow depth of field helps to isolate the subject from the background.",
  "color_lighting": "The soft, diffused lighting works very well for this subject. Most of the image is filled with greens and browns. However the berries add small areas of red which end up being a distraction. Red is a dominant color and even in small amounts will draw attention to itself. Because the dragonfly blends with its surroundings, I find my eye quickly going to the berries at the top of the image.",
  "focus": "Placement of focus is in the right area - on the dragonfly's body. More specifically the head/upper body of the dragonfly should be the precise point of focus. It looks like the sharpest area may be closer to the middle of the body - check the original image to know for sure.",

Overall this is a fairly pleasant shot but it's lacking in impact caused in the main by your composition. I've given a few suggestions below that you might like to try which may improve your shot. Once you have read through my suggestions, if you have specific questions about this shot please feel free to contact me via the messaging service. I hope you find my comments helpful and I look forward to seeing more of your shots. Kind regardsKen McKillopBlack Box Photographic.",

  "composition": "This is a fairly nice shot but the rose flower is right in the centre of the shot with little in the background to give good contrasts. There are large patches of brown and green which don't add any value to your shot and are actually quite distracting",
  "use_of_camera": "Exposure and speed have been well managed to give good light throughout the shot although the ISO wherever possible should be as low as possible. I know on a modern digital camera, 400iso isn't high but as you have used a tripod here anyway, you could have afforded to slow the shutter down even further to reduce ISO noise to its lowest possible.",

You did a good job here and there isn't any real suggestions I can give you before seeing more of what you do... jugging by this shot alone you're doing an excellent job and I wouldn't find it strange if you get shot of the week with this one. Really well done!Anyway, I'm going to give you three standard advices here, regarding your equipment handling, not knowing if you have this or that workflow.

  "composition": "I think this composition is pretty good.  Shooting from the underbelly of the bridge provides the viewer with a unique perspective and powerful rendition of the bridge, which is usually portrayed from the side or from a distance with the upper parts of the span featured. To my eye the bridge serves as a sort of partition between the right and left hand sides of the composition. However in this case there is a visual imbalance that is apparent between the two image halves. On the right there is a distinct absence of visual stimuli, ie. .buildings, geographical features, etc.  On the left is a cityscape.  As a result of the way the image is partitioned I think this particular composition feels a little imbalanced.      ",
  "use_of_camera": "I like that you use a tripod for your shots.  It diminishes your mobility to a degree, but results in the long run in sharper images and a wider variety of exposure settings for your use.  In this case I think the image is a bit flat and has a magenta caste to it.  This looks like a dusk or dawn shot and as such will have less light available for your sensor to work with.  In this case, though I prefer 100 ISO, I think a higher ISO would work better.  ",

I say this because of the unique almost yellow color of the sunlight, and also because of the hue of the horizon through the archway being more yellow,cyan than blue.

  "composition": "The subject is good and tells an interesting story. The issues with this image are with the background. Mergers aren't good; they distract the eye, and I would have chosen a different background for this image. Move your perspective, a couple of steps in one direction or another to prevent the pole bisecting the ear, and the building coming out of the side of the head. The fence is also a bit of a distraction too. One of the basic lessons of photography is where does your eye go? White is a brilliant color, actually the absence of color, so I would have cropped the sky to a minimum, or better yet moved the subject to a different place, like a background of green trees. Also, I would have moved the subject within the frame to the left a bit to include all the arms and possibly the hands. The tight grip of the boy and his downward look is what gives image drama and emotional impact. Including all of the arms and hands would increase this story even more. The space on the left isn't adding anything to the image story.  ",
  "use_of_camera": "Exposure is fine.  ",
  "depth_of_field": "The background is slightly out of focus, I would have gone more and blur the background even more. This would have made the subject stand out from the background and slightly helped with the background merger issues. Selective focus, using a bigger aperture, like f5.6, f4, etc...A small number gives a bigger shutter opening size and less inherent depth of field.   ",
  "color_lighting": "Images taken under diffused lighting and cloudy skies are normally great for color. In this case, some post-processing to increase color saturation and contrast would help, and give the image a little more \"pop\". The secret is not to overdue these adjustments.

  "general_impression": "Hi Nui, Thanks for sharing this image.  I can understand why you felt the need to capture it.  The dark black trunks of the oak trees and branches against the moss green of the foliage is very captivating and evokes a peaceful and tranquil mood.  I think there are some things you could have done to improve this image as well as some you can do in Photoshop to enhance what you have captured already.  ",
  "subject_of_photo": "The forest and deep canopied areas of the earth are always great subjects because of the intricacy of form and texture that is available.  They are also the most difficult to capture.  There are many nice facets to this image that I think work nicely.  There are also a couple of elements that I don't think work together as well as they could.  ",
  "composition": "I think the composition is not as strong as it might be considering the very nice organic lines and textures in this image that sort of meander interestingly around the mid distance point.  I think that foreground objects are certainly desirable here to provide framing and scale as well as a sense of depth, but I don't think the vine in the foreground provides much in the way of compositional balance. In fact, in tandem with the large interesting tree trunk, which alone would provide a nice boundary on that side of the image, the vine almost overloads that side of the image visually.  I like the overall look of this photo but feel there are some elements that subtly distract the viewers attention. One of these is the amount of sky that shows through the trees in the upper right portion of the frame. The light sort of blooms out a bit and tends to diffuse the impact of the rest of the image.  ",
  "use_of_camera": "I think that your settings were okay.  But I think that in this case you may have wished to consider a smaller aperture to ensure that you had a wider latitude of focus.  Perhaps f/8 or f/11 or so.  But of course this would have extended your exposure considerably to perhaps 1/60 or 1/30 of a second and necessitated a tripod. I think the overall exposure is pretty good and even with little to no harsh contrast.  If anything there is a little bit of overexposure in the sky area in the top center and right of the image and a tendency to emphasize midtones in the image, dulling the overall look of it.  ",
  "depth_of_field": "",
  "color_lighting": "I love the colors and hues here.  The mood it creates is one of a peaceful, somber, moist forest environment. As I mentioned above the lighting is good but could use some contrast to enhance some of the more subtle branches, and thus form, in the picture.  ",
  "focus": "The focus here looks a bit soft.  Its difficult to tell how soft since the image is such a low resolution one that is used on site.  I have a difficult time with this image finding a central point of focus.  But if you are using auto focus its not unreasonable to suggest that the camera has a difficult time with the confusing mlange of branches and leaves and contrasting light.",

As I mentioned above, I think I might have opened-up the shutter just a little more, and really keep the depth-of-field narrow, also pushing the foreground out-of-focus, keep the head as the main focal point.  HOwever, maybe some camera limitations also come into play here. ",
  "color_lighting": "As I mentioned above, the highlights are a bit burnt-out on the neck and around the ear, which is a bit of a shame.  You mention \"built-in\" flash, so am I right to assume you have fill-flash here?  If so, maybe it was a bit on the strong side.  Otherwise of course, the lighting is the most prominent aspect of the image and you've done a pretty good job given the extreme contrasts. ",

  "general_impression": "I think this image is a keeper George.  I really like the innovative and unique point of view of this image, as well as the energy and dynamic tension it creates.  The only concern I have is the shadow blocking in your subjects, but even that is not disastrous as the forms are clear as to what they are.  Nonetheless here are a few ideas you may wish to consider for this image.",
  "subject_of_photo": "I think this is a good image with a lot going for it.  I like the feel of adventure and mystery, along with exuberance and energy that this image evokes.",
  "composition": "The composition here is innovative, energetic and immediately compelling to the viewer.  The canted angle point of view creates a very powerful dynamic motion within the image that feels almost tangible.  The juxtaposition of the bright lines of light coming in through the gaps in the walls, with the dark shadows adds to the interest factor in this image by creating drama.  The skewed angle of the lines also provides a rather geometric spiral that draws the eye into the composition all the way to the bright area at the back of the scene. They actually appear, although they are individual squares of lines, to be connected in a sort of rectangular vortex through which your subjects are running. The motion suggested by the three subjects is forward while the apparent motion, to me, of the lines is front to back.  This increases the apparent relative motion of the image in general.",
  "use_of_camera": "I think that your settings were for the most part good.  The unique lighting environment you had was not the easiest one to shoot in. The bright light at the end of the tunnel, and the light pouring in through the cement gaps probably caused your camera to meter the scene as requiring a faster shutter speed.  I'm assuming you used your in camera meter to determine your manual settings here.  But I also can see that you had little latitude relative to shutter speed if you wanted to capture the action of the three children running.  Perhaps the ISO could have been a little higher say 250 or even 500 to allow you a fast shutter speed and still allow for a little more light falling into the shadow areas on the children's faces and clothing. Frankly I think the lighting is very good considering you used no fill flash here which may have helped you with the shadow areas some. ",
  "depth_of_field": "Surprisingly good to me. I see good focus and resolution throughout the image from foreground to background which is surprising considering how relatively wide your aperture was. But I also see that you were using a 12mm wide angle focal length so that helped considerably to provide apparent sharpness through the focal range.    ",
  "color_lighting": "As I mentioned above I like the contrast of the tunnel and the blocked shadows don't concern me there. I think that the image is a little dark.  I' m not sure how much more shadow detail you may lose if you were to print this.  The histogram for this image indicates that most of your tonal values, possibly 90% of all your pixels, fall in the mid tone to shadow area. There is a lot of shadow blocking or clipping here which is fine in the walls and peripheral foreground, but the figures in the image are also a bit dark and blocked up.  I think a little more light on them would have popped this image a bit more. I think presented as a monitor rendering it is fairly easy to see shadow detail that might otherwise be missing in a printed version.  But the overall effect is very compelling and works well. ",

  "general_impression": "I very much like this image. It evokes a mood that is both mysterious and peaceful. The capture was well timed to catch the light so well. I can see why the judges liked this image in the photo contest it was entered. ",
  "subject_of_photo": "Stephanie, I truly like the moment and feeling that this image evokes. This image is so much less about the river and the rocks than it is about the very brief moment of light pouring through the canopy of trees, thus creating a brief mystical tapestry. ",
  "composition": "I also like the balance and movement of this image.  The river leads your eye up into the frame and the light brings it back down near the center left 1/3 of the image.  The perspective is not particularly unique and is shot from what appears to be a standing vantage point but in this case works just fine.",
  "use_of_camera": "This image appears to be taken in a fairly dark environment under a canopy of foliage and in late afternoon (judging by the angle of the light beams).  A tripod would have really helped with this image creating less camera shake, and allowing you to use a smaller aperture setting which would have helped sharpen the image (and increase depth of field.)",
  "depth_of_field": "The depth of field appears to be fairly shallow with most of the sharpness found on the light shaft itself.  Its difficult to tell however considering the overall softness of the image.  Considering the wide aperture setting it is not unexpected that the depth of field would be quite shallow.",
  "color_lighting": "I'm not sure what conditions you actually saw and perhaps the image accurately represents the true color, saturation and contrast of the scene. But the image could benefit tremendously by a few post processing adjustments by bringing up the highlights, darkening the shadow areas and dropping the mid tone adjustments just a bit. As it stands now, it is a good photo but is a little flat and dull and somewhat unsaturated. There are also a few blown highlights that, while understandable given the nature of the lighting, could be reduced by some of the adjustments to the levels mentioned above, ie. . see the right hand side of the large rock illuminated by the light shafts. Some selective darkening of the blown highlights there and, conversely some dodging of some of the water highlights and foliage would make the image pop a bit. ",
  "focus": "The focus appears to me to be a little soft and I'm not sure whether it is due to atmospheric conditions or simply the use of a very wide aperture and the shot being taken by hand without a tripod.  ",

  "general_impression": "Hello Nicola and thanks for asking me to provide feedback on your Jackdaw photograph. Overall I like this shot and as a subject, he is great. They are easy to attract and feed so long as they are not in a group of rooks who will bully their way to any feed and are fairly common in urban parks so there's usually plenty of opportunity to see them. You haven't provided much information about your shot, ISO, shutter speed, depth of field etc and that's something that if you have another photograph for critique, either by me or another pro you should provide so we can give you the best possible feedback. There are a couple of fairly straightforward things that you could try which would help improve this shot and I've given a couple of ideas for you to try. Remember though that if you want to ask questions about my feedback, you can contact me via the messaging service. I hope you find my comments helpful. Kind regards,Ken McKillop",

  "composition": "Nearly there with the composition Andrew. The bridge draws the eye through the photograph from the bottom left to the right as well as with the reflection drawing the eye back down to the bottom of the frame - which is good. But if you played around with how the bridge filled the frame you may have been able to continue drawing the eye to the right hand upper corner. It looks like it might have been challenging to get physically closer to the bridge but by filling the frame more with the bridge and shooting a little higher would you have been able to get a fuller, more emotive reflection and fill more of the frame with the bridge? In doing so you could have filled the frame with more of the beautiful orange in the sky.",
  "use_of_camera": "My thoughts are more along the lines of: it's not the tools but the master, so the camera isn't all that important. By underexposing a by a stop you were able to bring out the beautiful colours of the sunset and keep the silhouette of the bridge in tact, while keeping the reflections visible.If you used a tripod you would be able to get a super crisp shot so you could get more details of the wood of the bridge and the grass and really make the image pop. ",
  "depth_of_field": "Great depth of field. Everything that needs to be in focus is.

And it's not just intersex but also inter-animal species in body shaping, though this is not what you're interested in. There is the lizard man and feline women and so much more.

  "general_impression": "Hi, Annelly, in your description of the photo opportunity you said that you \"just liked the scenery\". It's good to bring back records of our travels so we can reminisce. When you look at this image, no doubt, you'll remember the weather conditions (it was warm, or it was cool) and the stillness of the day (I assume because there are no ripples on the water!). You'll remember the ambient sounds (birds, automobiles, the rural environment). You'll remember the smell of the air and the vegetation.  You may remember it as a particular time in your life. In other words, you'll remember the total experience of you being in that place at that time.Consequently, when you later view this image, it will mean more to you, and be more attractive to you, than it can be for anyone else.A viewer like me can only experience the place visually through your photograph. No sounds, smells, warmth or coolness on the skin...breeze through the hair, etcetera. That's what makes it hard for a documentary image of an ordinary scene to hold the interest of someone who doesn't have a connection with it.Your image doesn't hold my interest because it's an average snapshot. But I would like to be honest and say that I would struggle to make an interesting image in this place if my PoV was dictated solely by a bridge. If I had a longer lens than your 18-55mm lens I might be able to do something more with the scene by zooming in on particular details and seeing what I could do with them in terms of composition. There are interesting elements in the scene: vegetation; river; reflections; textures; light and shade; the high viewpoint. But it will take a good eye for composition to extract something more than an average snapshot from this scene.Thank you for choosing me to critique your image, Annelly. I hope that my comments are helpful to you in your journey in photography.If it moves you, shoot it!Kind regards,Rob Smith AAPS",
  "subject_of_photo": "Annelly, this is a documentary record of a pleasant scene that you've happened upon. Unfortunately, there's no strong point of interest that captures my attention and makes me want to study it. This is the kind of image that I describe as a stage that has been set. It's just waiting for some actors to appear, so to speak. Those actors don't have to be people. They can be animals, objects or even something as simple as an indication of movement. Consider how different this image might look if you'd tossed a stone into the river in the area that reflects the sky. Suddenly the radiating ripples would become a focal point for the viewer and cause the viewer to ask questions. What made the ripples? Was it a fish, a diving duck, or a stone thrown from afar? The inclusion of some point of interest, however small, gives the image a chance of suggesting that a story is unfolding in the scene. That will give something for the viewer to ponder.",
  "composition": "Annelly, I understand that you may have had little scope to change your point of view (PoV) for this image: the position from which you took it. You were passing by on a bridge, so you may have had little time to explore the location to look for a compelling viewpoint. Perhaps it was too dangerous or difficult to look for a position away from the bridge. Whatever the reason, taking a photograph from the bridge doesn't help you to make a great photograph if the view from the bridge is ordinary. The photograph that you took from the bridge will likely be similar to photographs that many other people have taken from that bridge before or in the future. You've used your lens at its maximum focal length so it wasn't possible to zoom further in to specific areas of interest within the scene...unless you had another lens in your bag. If you had a longer lens, it would have been a good idea to use it, in my opinion.",
  "use_of_camera": "1/160th @ f5.6 & 55mm ISO 200Your use of the camera is satisfactory. Exposure and focus are accurate, as we'd expect with a camera such as your Canon 1000D used in automatic mode. Sometimes modern cameras get it wrong in auto mode, and in those circumstances the photographer needs to know how to use exposure compensation features of the camera to pull it back into line. But this image is fine in that respect.",
  "depth_of_field": "",
  "color_lighting": "The scene contains about a 60:40 mix of shade and sunlit areas. The brightly lit areas appear to have a warm colour balance, and the shadows (being illuminated by skylight) are slightly cooler. This is to be expected. The colour appearance of the image is satisfactory. The brightly lit areas of vegetation adjacent to the shaded areas have been mirror-reflected in the river, and this has set up a pleasing contrast between the upright reality and the inverted reflections.",

  "general_impression": "Liam, A very nice image.  It does indeed portray a calm, and serene sense of peace and power at the same time.  Below are some ideas you may wish to consider to bring out some of the images more subdued strong points.  ",
  "subject_of_photo": "Liam, I think you captured the mood that you were attempting very well.  The image presents both a minimalist feel and a sense of serenity and calm beauty.  ",
  "composition": "I think there is a generalized feeling of balance and symmetry, and even though there is little in the way of leading lines or curves into the frame, being a mostly horizontal orientation of objects, I think this lends itself well to the quiet and static mood you were attempting to capture. I think a little bit more of the water in the lower half of the frame would have perhaps set the horizon line a little higher and provided more of a smooth gradient area to further enhance the calm, Zen-like mood of this image. I also feel that perhaps inclusion of some referential foreground object in the lower frame might have also provided a visual anchor and sense of depth and scale to the image.  ",
  "use_of_camera": "There is no perfect exposure, and there are some exposures that are simply unworkable, but most of the time, particularly with the new camera technology, exposures usually fall within an acceptable range for you to work with.  You were shooting stopped down to f/22, using a long exposure time of 30 seconds, resulting in that nice sharp sunburst over the mountains.  But the long exposure also resulted in a lot of loss of sky detail particularly in the area around the sunburst. This is of course a predictable outcome when shooting directly into the sun.  I don't know what sort of accessories or filters you might have had but I think that the overall image in this case is a little overexposed (not fatally so), but enough to dull some of the wonderful detail you have in the sky.  You also ended up with an unavoidable group of round lens flares on the lower right of your image since no lens hood can successfully prevent them when shooting straight into the sun.  Leaving them in place is a matter of taste.   ",
  "depth_of_field": "",
  "color_lighting": "I think, despite the relative overexposure in the sky, the lighting is good and amenable to adjustment in post processing without excess noise or degradation.  The colors are also very nice.  I like the complimentary yellow/orange sky melded with the cool blue and cyan colors of the mountain and lake.  I also think that the warmer colors are carried nicely into the water generally from horizon to foreground and more graphically in the long reflection of the sun in the water. The lighting appears soft while allowing the hard edge of the mountain ridges to stand out agains the sky.  ",
  "focus": "Its difficult to tell how tack sharp the image may be considering there is little detail in the water from the long exposure, and the resolution of the image here is not the native resolution but rather a down sampled jpeg which will always deteriorate relative to resolution.  But considering that the edges of the mountain look acceptably sharp so I will guess the sharpness of the original is good as well.  ",

  "general_impression": "Hi Mary,  I think this image presents very well and creates both a story line and a mood of mystery and exotic possibility. There isn't much about this image that many would take to task, but the things that I have noted might be things to consider on future shots, and when performing your post processing tasks.    ",
  "subject_of_photo": "I like this image quite a bit.  It is one of the 'story telling' kind of images wherein the subject is not one or more of the objects but rather the synthesis created between them.  In this case the viewer is treated to some nice visual treats, and a human figure who is on her way to somewhere, in a rather exotic and mystical setting (at least from the Western perspective) ",
  "composition": "There are lots of interesting and engaging lines and forms here.  Enough to provide a pleasing visual to the viewer.  The texture and detail in the structures facade draws the viewer in and is held there by the simple, smooth textures of the wall.  The solitary female figure draws the eye into the center once again from the leading left edge of the image and then the eye is drawn upwards by the vertical walls and pointed turret caps on the sides of the facade.  There is a nice break in the movement created by the arched light fixtue that curves back down into the composition as well. I think that the wide angle you used 24mm (not exceptionally wide, but enough when tilted slightly up, to skew the perspective a bit of the architectural lines) created some vertical distortion on the building.  Its not severe but noticable to a degree.  Sometimes this effect works very well to create a crazy, sort of surreal or avant garde mood to a composition.  Here though I think it is a little unsettling simply because the distortion is so subtle that the minds eye sees it before the viewer recognizes what it is.   ",
  "use_of_camera": "I have no issues here.  Just a couple of questions.  I see you used 500 ISO, from the camera data supplied, if correct, it looks like midday shot with plenty of light, albeit some of the facade in light shade.  Why not use a lower ISO say 200 or 100 if you have the latitude.  Just curious.  Also it looks like you were tilting the camera up at a slight angle as evidenced by the vertical perspective distortion on the building, yet the womans figure appears to be shot at a normal perspective straight on and relatively level.  Not a big deal but just something to think about.  Thank you for clarifying that the woman is a composited element.  It is actually pretty good but there are some telling things that upon close examination sort of give it away.  First her nose is relatively transparent, if that is in fact her nose, which can be possibly attributed to a soft selection of that part of her body.  Secondly the feet have become rather muddy and muddled and don't blend naturally onto the background as you might expect.  ",
  "depth_of_field": "Good",
  "color_lighting": "I very much like the muted, yet rich colors of this image.  And the global low contrast nature of the light on the building although it appears to have been taken at mid day.  I also like the mix of colors from the womans pinkish silk clothing against the orange/sandstone hued walls of the structure.  I do notice a slight halo around the building that I'm not sure isn't natural, its just noticable as if there were some localized dodging of the palace that maybe was carried on to the blue sky behind the building.  If this is a natural phenomenon ignore this comment, if it is due to processing or dodging then just be cognizant of the bleed over onto areas you do not wish to affect with the lightening.  ",

I do wonder however if it would have been possible for you to get closer to increase the size of the waterfall within the frame.

Forgive me for being perhaps a bit hard in my critique but I feel that you are on the right track to become a good photographer. Your subject was a very hard one to make work, even for the best.",
  "subject_of_photo": "Some photographs just don't want to be classified... Not that this is necessarily the case here, but you having chosen the category of fine art raises some questions. Such questions like those raised by Duchamp with his ready-mades. I guess the subject here is not what is relevant but your choice for the description. Anyway, regarding the subject plain and simple, I can say there is always wonder in light passing by trees and grasses.I would go further and say that in this particular view I rather have the tree as the subject and would love to see it play a different role. But the grasses are nice, although to bright for the background and they take the brightness out of the tree.I love backlit subjects...",
  "composition": "Composition is rather simple, but you already know that. It's not random, you have chosen well how to frame the tree from the standing point of who was invaded by the light reflected on the golden cold grasses. The tree punctuates the photograph as it isn't just there but drawn to the right. But it lacks perspective, not only in the geometric sense... A long telephoto lens always deprives it's subjects from depth...There is some twirling of the grasses, which is interesting, but not enough to make the elements of this composition communicate.",
  "use_of_camera": "This is pretty much a good camera for everything, almost everything...Regarding the speed there is nothing that really needs any say, it's the exposure that I  don't think was the best for the situation. In one hand we have an over exposed grass and in the other the shadowed background is almost invisible. There is just too much contrast for an easy approach.",
  "depth_of_field": "I'm rating this one very low because there is a bit of a conflict here. You have chosen to use a focal distance that promotes the selection of subjects by it's very low depth of field but than closed your aperture to a point where you lost the selection effect of your lens low depth of field.In this case, the obvious thing using this long telephoto would be to go with an open aperture to have the tree standing out from the rest, wile still having the grasses playing a strong part. This way everything would benefit.",

  "focus": "Photographs are being displayed larger the before here, but they aren't still not big enough for the naked eye to correctly see if the focus is on spot, so it's risky to give the maximum rating.

As much as I can see the tree is in perfect focus... and I would go as far as to say that it's the tree that need to be on focus.But there is something that could work out better for this choice of focus...",

  "general_impression": "Hi Tony,Great introduction to your shot! Welcome to my little corner in Gurushots. Using an iPhone as handy camera everywhere you go without thinking on taking a better camera or the usual walk around kit, as proved to be more than viable.Taking into account that this is an iPhone shot it hard to go through with most point of the tech evaluation for critique and further improvement... I don't know the app so I can't know if it allows for some control or not, so I guess I'll have to keep to the subject and composition, and make a few remarks on the rest.I'm not going to put the iPhone down, a lot of good work has been done with it and no one can say that for such a tiny lens the result is bad. It's pretty good considering the hardware. Of course that for it to have a good look it needs some 'masking' like that of those app adding effects for this and that. Anyway, I'm not going to put that down to, because it has a place in photography.For a quick snapshot with no requirements on technical quality, that point & shoot that most of us do with our cell phones, iPhone is a winner. For some types of low-fi art projects iPhone can be interesting. For quality work a minimum quality camera is advised.Regarding what you've done here, I feel a contradiction. The composition is not that old style so if in one hand you found a way to capture these two nice old school bikes, in the other hand the effect of an old lens with lot's of vignetting doesn't really match the angle and proximity of this shot. So I guess that wile your objective was getting there in the effect it's not on the angle and composition.Keep using your iPhone! But if you're into recreating old style photographs I would suggest you do it with a better camera so you can control the process and be more efficiently creative there.Anyway, I really love to get honesty like yours and hope to see you back soon!Cheers",

  "general_impression": "Choice of Monochrome to portray Machu Picchu is a wonderful idea. The ruggedness of the rocks and the turbulence in the clouds make it a very interesting frame. The rustic and mysterious feel of this place has come out well. Its a brilliant frame!",
  "subject_of_photo": "The choice of subject is interesting - a combination of the rocks/wall, the clouds around the guard house! The inconsistent shapes and sizes of the rocks is adding to the appeal. The subject is a bit far away to suggest that it is a guard house though.",
  "composition": "Taken from the bottom with bigger rocks, leading up to the guard house and then the clouds is a different & nice perspective. The composition is very effective in showing the Inca-carved walls of this place - known so well and still mysterious to many. Placing the guard house off-center may have been a good idea with a subtle change in the angle. ",
  "use_of_camera": "Well exposed image with the right choice of metering ensuring no blown out areas in the sky - right exposure with the guard house have realistic light around it. Shooting it at a higher f-number would have yielded more details of the elements in the frame(say beyond f-11). Since it was shot in daylight, ISO 720 seemed higher - could have done it at a lower ISO.",
  "depth_of_field": "Depth of field is good, but assuming that the idea was to portray all the layers i.e., the series of rocks one over the other, unto the guard house, a higher DOF would have been good idea. Either a relatively shallow (top-down/ bottom-up) or a high-DOF would be better options, instead of moderate DOF.",

I'm glad to see you're discovering the advantages of shooting manual. Switching to B&W in post was a very good choice and very well executed. I would have liked to see the whole top of the tree especially since its roots are so visible but still a very powerful image. Well done!!!",

  "composition": "The perspective is really good. Head on and engaging. I rated 7 more for the composition as I would have liked to see the edges of the branches. The way it is now it is a little abrupt and the image loses its continuity. It's not close enough to be focusing on detail but not far enough to include the whole subject.",

  "general_impression": "Hi John, Nice image again.  I don't know if you intended the representation to be more graphic and less photographic so its difficult to comment about how well you accomplished your 'intent'. I think the image is very nice as I said, and I also think there are some things that might advocate against a large print of this image. This would mainly be the amount of softening of the detail areas from what appears to be a lot of noise removal.  The faces of the surfers, as well as the broader smooth water areas, have taken on a smooth soft waxy look (which probably accentuates the rather painted effect).  Here's a few comments that you may wish to consider or incorporate.",
  "subject_of_photo": "Nice imagery again John. This could well be the wall art companion piece to the first one you sent for review. ",
  "composition": "I think the composition here is fine.  This is purely subjective but I feel as if the motion of the image is hindered a bit by the placement nearly center, of the two surfers.  Its balanced and not unpleasant, but my eye wants to see more of a space into which the surfers can move into which calls, subjectively again, for them to be further right on the frame plane. I like how the horizontal motion of the surfers is encapsulated by the swirling, radial motion of the water all around them.  It creates an energy dissonance that works very well.  ",
  "use_of_camera": "I think your settings, which are pretty much duplicates of the first image I reviewed, work well for capturing the motion and stopping the action.  As I mentioned before a lower ISO would have been nice, but then you sort of get what you get in terms of lighting and have even fewer choices when shooting at telephoto ranges.  I think since the 200mm lens put you further from the action, it would have been optimal to have had access to a 400 to 600 mm lens just so that you didn't lose resolution in the resizing to get your subjects to fill the frame more.  ",
  "depth_of_field": "",
  "color_lighting": "The color cast creates an interesting painterly effect on the image.  I don't find the cast (blue and cyan) to be objectionable, but as I mentioned before, it is readily apparent.  The lighting is even and free of harsh shadows and contrast.  I like the subtle dark vignette look in the upper left of the frame as it provides a bit of depth and volume to the image as well as a sense of drama. ",

  "general_impression": "Hi Fraser. Congratulations on creating a very Zen photograph. The image is optimistic and communicates creativity and a desire to build ideas while respecting tradition. You have clearly thought about the positioning of the pencils, and as a web banner it is perfect since it would be easy to integrate typography into the image.",
  "subject_of_photo": "One the things I like about this image is its simplicity. You have managed to keep it simple and uncluttered. Nothing is competing for attention with the pencils. You have created a very Zen image. As a web header it is strong, clear and communicates a sense of creativity and potential. Pencils are tools from which ideas can be expressed. You are projecting a very optimistic outlook through this image, and if I didn't know any better I would suggest you are someone who likes building new ideas and exploring.",
  "composition": "Like a portrait, you have managed to capture the raw personality of the pencils. By photographing them from the front you have illustrated the beautiful natural textures of the wood while also showing a beautiful sense of depth. I also like how you have positioned them. It is unexpected but balanced.",
  "use_of_camera": "Your exposure is good. You have details both in the shadows and highlights.",
  "depth_of_field": "By using a shallow depth of field you have drawn attention to the tips of the pencils. The fact that the pencils appear to have been used encourages curiosity. If I was to take this image, I would aim for a greater depth of field. It is a bit soft for me.",
  "color_lighting": "The image has a very warm feeling about it. If I was to guess, you have used tungsten lighting. It is pleasing and makes the image welcoming which is important when using it for a web banner. Your choice of lighting and angle is well chosen. By lighting from the side you have created interesting pockets of shadow and light emphasising texture.",
  "focus": "Due to the positioning of the pencils, the focal point in this image is very clear. The pencils also look like they have been used and you have helped communicate this by locking onto the tips of the pencils as your focal point. It makes me wonder what they were used for before you took this image. It sparks curiosity.",

But what stroke me the strongest was the fact that we can clearly see the difference between the cross on top and the lightning rod, that's interesting and it's not the typical view you'd expect to see. Well done on that!The composition is not particularly interesting though.. and I would expect more vivid colours in Mexico, but I'm not saying you should have it more saturated.The down side here is that this is not a very good example of architectural photography, this is more the relationship of a detail with it's surroundings in a more plastic kind of mix. This tower gains a lot by being shown with it's two levels.But I'm sure you have more of this and I'm already imagining different angles. There is a lot you could have done better here but I can see that you have a keen eye and mind set for a different approach and I value that quite a lot!Can't wait to see what you'll bring up next, this is if you found my comments useful.Cheers",

  "general_impression": "Hi Gary thanks for choosing me to critique your image. Overall, I think you did a solid job! My favorite parts of the image are the background mountains as well as the sky, trees, and green grass. It sure looks like it was a beautiful day! Excellent job as well on your reflection as I think it was well captured and I can tell that you put some thought and effort into choosing your composition for this scene. I hope that you my suggestions will help you with this photograph as well your photography in general. I'll provide you with some technical suggestions for improvement as well a a general tip to finish up.",
  "subject_of_photo": "Between the buildings, people, tractor, lock, trees, sky and mountains there is a lot going on in this picture. The lock is an original subject and the refection is well captured. Overall, I like the subject, but I also feel there are a lot of secondary elements competing for your viewer's attention. ",
  "composition": "I like the angle that you chose to photograph the lock as well as the placement of the horizon in picture. Furthermore, the major tree is well positioned and you included just enough \"breathing room\" for it - in the foreground as well as the sky. What I think could be improved are the sides of the frame. The left side of the picture has a couple of extenuating elements that I find distracting most notably the tractor and also the green sign beneath the building. That area of the frame seems a bit convoluted to me. While the right side of the frame doesn't offer much in terms of aesthetics, I feel it could have been used more effectively as a leading line as the sidewalk is cut off. ",
  "use_of_camera": "If you've read any of my previous critiques you'll know that I am not a big fan of the 5.6 aperture setting. However, in this case, I think it worked out well. Your depth of field looks good in the foreground and background. I think your exposure is excellent - there isn't any noticeable noise in the shadows. You have a few blown highlights throughout the frame. Most noticeably one small patch of sky as well as some of the guardrails and the white siding on the house illuminated in light in the middle portion of your frame. I also think your shutter speed was an excellent choice to freeze the action of the people walking up the stairs.",
  "depth_of_field": "I don't see any noticeable issues with your depth of field. It looks acceptably clear front to back and side to side.",
  "color_lighting": "The color balance that you chose is slightly cool and it works very well. The dappled light from the partly cloudy day works extremely well for this image. The trio of green, blue, and white effectively balances the photograph. The contrast is excellent. Overall, I'd say this is the strongest portion of your image based on the categories listed here.",

  "general_impression": "Hi John, as a big fan of \"natural\" looking candid shots, I'm very impressed with this shot. You caught exactly the right moment, using your technical knowledge to use your camera and lens as an extension of your eye, to shoot what you wanted to show. Overall, a near perfect picture, my sincere compliments !",
  "subject_of_photo": "Children make for great photographic subjects, especially when they're obviously enjoying themselves while losing track of the camera pointed at them. This child is visibly entranced by the ball and the scene looks very natural; a great subject, and a great photographic opportunity ! I must admit my opinion is influenced a lot by my two-month-old son; because I take professional photographs on my working days, I never felt the urge to take a lot of pictures in my spare time, but your own baby changes all that, and there has been a very noticeable peak in the number of photographs I take in my spare time. I'm pretty confident this shot would have put a big smile on my face even before I became a father myself; you can feel the excitement and the concentration in this very endearing shot; my compliments !",
  "composition": "Even with a short depth of field, complex elements in the fore- and background can distract from the main subject. With the close crop you chose you made sure all the attention  is kept on Jamie. The net and the vertical line in the left background look slightly tilted. My personal preference would be to have these level, but that's a very minor detail; overall the composition looks great !",
  "use_of_camera": "Using aperture priority and your widest available aperture, you're guaranteed to get the fastest shutter speed possible under the given circumstances. A good choice if you want to be able to react quickly without having to worry if you will be able to \"freeze\" the action. All the technical details provided show you really knew what you were doing; well done !",
  "depth_of_field": "Excellent; the unsharp net adds to the sense of depth and the background is sufficiently out of focus not to distract from Jamie. Nothing to improve here; good job !",
  "color_lighting": "A high ISO rating instead of using flash produced the most atmospheric shot possible; even with a complex lighting setup using multiple strobes, remotely triggered, you would have lost some of the natural \"feel\" of the lighting. With artificial light, tint and color temperature are difficult to control, but you did so extremely well with this image. Some photographers would prefer a bit more contrast or a slightly more neutral color, but I think the color temperature you chose really works here.",
  "focus": "When examining the image up close, the structure on the bat looks slightly shaper than Jamies eyes, but don't get me wrong : there isn't a lack of sharpness. For an available light shot with this ISO rating, the image is as sharp as it could be.",

  "subject_of_photo": "Pretty clear... ",
  "composition": "I really enjoy the angles here - the smokey eerie orange swirls in the background running NE to SW, intersecting the monster's spear and spine, which are nicely aligned.  My eye circles around the image nicely, face to spear to right arm, to spine, back up.  I even like that you cropped the end of the hanging \"sleeve\" on the right arm, a less predictable crop, but makes more sense, since the lower body is also cropped out.  Left arm is nicely aligned w/ the edge of the image.  Really, very nice.  The position of it's left hand at its cheek is curious.",
  "use_of_camera": "The swinging fabric that dangles off of the edges of the monster are sharp.  While certainly a non-traditional \"exposure,\" it works.",
  "depth_of_field": "This was the first thing I liked about the image - despite the strongly 2 dimensional outlining of the monster, looking closely you do see depth and shape.  Particularly in the larger hollows - the chest, the abdomen, the eye sockets, and between the closest fingers.  Looks like an xray to me.  That adds to the \"fear\" factor because it combats the cartoonish nature of the rainbow colors and gives more realistic shape.  Depth would definitely be strengthened by less of a fight between warm & cool colors though.",
  "color_lighting": "Interesting choices.  Here's where I think this image could improve a bit.  The color choice in the background, the warm orangey mist, works.  The monster, however is sort of a rainbow of colors, both cool & warm, with the bright outline.  I believe if you were to restrict your monster's colors within the warm color palette, this might seem less cartoonish and more haunting.  The rainbow colors take a lot of the seriousness out of the image.",

The digital development of you RAW in the shadows is not looking very natural here, this even has somewhat the feel of that trendy HDR look we see so much now and that is definitely not a good thing for me.The highlights are quite good for the subject, those sparks on the water really have to be like that because they are no longer just highlights, they are specular lights and are supposed to have gone beyond our perception of texture. You just have to be sure that you don't have any on the border, and this is something that you can very easily fix in post digital developing.I seriously don't think we should use the term 'processing' both for the automatic processing in camera and the manual processing of the RAW after shooting. With RAW manual processing what we're actually doing is digital development. I'm trying to see this named correctly... let's see how it goes.",

The whole shadows under the skyline have a bit of this feel.",

  "general_impression": "Hi, Carl. Thank you for choosing me to critique your image. I hope that my comments seem both fair and useful to you. If you can take one or two things away from this that you can use next time then I'll have done my job.The hummingbird appeals to me as a subject although in this case there are a number of things that have let the image down. I mentioned earlier that I like the general composition. It's conventional and safe and that's OK. You had to work quickly with what was presented.Being a zoologist by training, I was interested to learn more about the Bearded Helmetcrest. That sent me off 'a Googling' to satisfy my curiosity. I've now seen a number of photographs of this species, and that helps me to make some suggestions for your 'next time'.I have seen, in other images, that this species has some interesting head and facial markings. Unfortunaely, they're not apparent in your photograph.I think that the main failing of this image, in terms of holding my interest, is that the bird isn't doing anything interesting and looks glum. Photographs of birds simply perching on sticks are common. We need to bring back something more than that to grab the viewer's attention. Hummingbirds are dynamic creatures and this one isn't very dynamic. Admittedly, capturing it on the wing would be another kettle of fish, but there are some things that you could do to make even this static capture of the Bearded Helmetcrest more interesting.Indeed, with its fluffed feathers, this little fellow gives me the impression that it's either ailing or cold (perhaps it was a cool cloudy day, even for the Columbian or Venezuelan rainforest). Maybe it's a bad day for a nectar feeder because the sun isn't out and the flowers aren't open. Your hummingbird doesn't appear to be living up to its frenetic reputation. It's not humming along!I hope the suggestions below give you some food for thought. All the best with your photography, Carl. If it moves you, shoot it!Rob Smith AAPS ",
  "subject_of_photo": "The hummingbird is dominant in the frame with a subdued background that avoids distracting elements. I presume it's perched on a food plant and that adds to the overall interest or story of the photograph.",
  "composition": "I like the diagonal dynamic of the composition. The bird's visual weight is counterbalanced by the larger shape of the plant anchored in bottom right corner. Together these two elements create a quasi triangular shape that points to the top left hand corner. That's the diagonal dynamic I refer to.I like that the photographer's point of view (PoV) seems to be slightly below the bird's eye level. This has the viewer looking slightly up to the hummingbird. This also enhances the dominance of the bird as main subject. You must have been very close to the bird because I see that the focal length used was equivalent to about 70mm on a full frame camera. That's pretty close to have such a small bird dominate the frame. Unless, of course, the image was heavily cropped.Negative space is the empty space in a composition that surrounds physical elements. In this case, the negative space is the dull grey background that lets the bird and plant be viewed without distractions. You've made very good use of compositional negative space and contrast. The relationship between negative and positive space is also called a figure-ground relationship (a figure against its background). We can also say that this image has pleasing figure-ground shape relationships.",
  "use_of_camera": "Apart from the focus issue, you've produced an otherwise competent image. Most would agree that the compact camera you've used is not the ideal equipment for wildlife photography, but it's hard to argue that in relation to your image. You do seem to have got close enough to make a good photograph of a small bird. Your shutter speed of 1/89s on auto and the moderately wide aperture (for this camera) of f4.1 may be contributing to the lack of apparent sharpness or focus. I can see that the light must have been quite low to require 1/89s @ f4.1 & ISO 100. You could have increased ISO to 200 or 400 to allow a faster shutter or higher aperture number and that may have improved the crispness of the image. However, for a compact camera such as the one you've used, you probably can't increase ISO significantly without incurring a digital noise penalty.",
  "depth_of_field": "One of the strengths of a compact camera such as you've used is great depth of field. Indeed, for some applications, the deep focus capability of compact cameras is a hindrance. But, in this case, it gives you the potential to have a lot of the bird and the plant in a zone of acceptable focus. However, as mentioned before, much of the bird, and important parts like the eye, is beyond the good depth of field zone. This could have been avoided if the camera was focussed a little further away than is evident here, to bring all of the bird and much of the plant into the zone of focus.To summarise, the equipment was capable of producing adequate depth of field for this image but your execution was not quite on the money, Carl.",
  "color_lighting": "I like the subdued lighting for this subject and the way that the bird seems to be slightly backlit or obliquely lit, as evidenced by the lightness around the edges of the bird's shape, and the subdued highlights on some of the leaves. Colour balance seems neutral so there are no perceptible issues with colour cast. I like the colour harmony in your image, Carl.",
  "focus": "Unfortunately the most important part of the bird, its eye, is not in focus. In fact, the sharpest areas of the image appear to be in the plant, closer to the camera, and perhaps the leading edge of the wing. Sharpness of focus falls away in the far side of the hummingbird.It may seem a clich, but it's true that in wildlife photography getting a sharp eye can be crucial to making the photograph hold the viewer's attention.",

I will do my best to help you evolve as a photographer.This is an interesting idea but there are a few things not really working for it to be a striking good image.

Not saying that she isn't and I'm sure she must be for you say she is but her expression is not telling me that. I feel that she is lacking determination but maybe this is due to her attention to you while photographing her.Other than that, and the fact that the over all image is a bit under contrasted for me, this is a good classic American Shot composition with a good balance of light.Please tell me if I have addressed most of your concerns here and if there is anything more I can do to help.Cheers",

I think you have actually done well with the exposure and perhaps it would benefit from some tweaking in Photoshop or another photo editor to bring out the color and detail in the shadow areas.",

You want the bird looking into the picture so visual space on the left side is great.The perspective is nice and its probably the only vantage point you could get.  Having the bird and nest nicely framed by the bridges girders is just great.  You placed yourself and the view of your subject so the cables and girders did not cross over his body.  Nicely done.",
  "use_of_camera": "This is where I have some issue with this image and I'm only nit picking.  Your ISO was very high at 1250.  This is introducing a lot of noise into your image.  I am guessing you were hand holding to catch this grab shot and needed the high ISO to achieve enough shutter speed at F5.6.  However, this does detract from the image quality.  On a tripod, iso 100 or 200 would have given you a much cleaner crisper image.",
  "depth_of_field": "As stated before, the depth of field seem to work well for this image",
  "color_lighting": "Artistically I like the color and lighting.  The greenish girders against an almost indiscernible white background looks very stark and geometric.  However, there does seem to be a greenish color cast over the entire image.  As you are working in Elements, open your image, Go to Enhance>adjust lighting>levels, Point to the white eyedropper and sample (click) on an area you know should be neutral or white like the goose head.  This will neutralize the color cast in the image.The sky is very blown out but that cant really be helped, this was a very tough exposure and I think the lack of detail in this case adds to the image.",
  "focus": "Your choice of focus at 5.6 seems to work in this image.  As the sky and background are not an integral part of the image a really deep depth of field was unnecessary and letting the background go soft keeps your eye on the subject and the design elements.",

This is a fine \"safe\" shot for this, but a reader or viewer will be much more drawn into the photo when there is some great action going on.",
  "composition": "Not bad, but the subject is too centered. Again, having a bit of action would be nice. The depth of field is too much. Opening up your aperture to f/4 with a shutter speed of 1/2000 (2000 on the info panel) would drop the background out of focus therefore making your subject pop out. Get down lower and closer to the rink. Don't be afraid to shoot through the glass.",
  "use_of_camera": "Try taking your camera off auto mode. Practice using manual so you understand the relationship between shutter speed and aperture and how the affect the image. Great choice on the ISO. I don't know if you set it, or if the camera did, but the brighter the scene, the lower your aperture. ",
  "depth_of_field": "The depth of field is too much. To keep attention on your main subject, and this is true especially in sports, opening your aperture wide will keep the background out of focus and help eliminate the clutter. Take a look at SI or images from major sporting teams. The background is usually very soft. Notice how it makes the subject pop out.A good exercise to learn DOF is to take your camera and put it on a tripod looking down along a picket fence or something with repetition. Take a set of photographs a different apertures AND with different focal length lenses (or your zoom at different zooms).Start with a wide angle lens. 1. Focus at a close point on the fence. Open your aperture wide (f/2.8) and take a photo. Change to f/4, then f/5.6 all the way to f/22.2. Now focus about 8-10 feet further, repeat3. Now focus at infinity, repeat.Switch to a medium focal length lens and repeat steps 1. to 3. Now go with a telephoto and repeat.This teaches you what the effect aperture has on your image and how it changes with focal length.",
  "color_lighting": "Love the side lighting. The lighting is good overall. Colors are good. Seems well balanced.Note: It's really difficult to judge exact color balance of a photograph on a screen due to variances in the color calibration. Your monitor may be set different than mine.But the color of this image looks really on target.",

  "composition": "I very much like the use of leading diagonal lines and vanishing point perspective here.  Nicely done.  It provides both a sense of balance and symmetry to the image but also of dynamic motion and fluidity.  The nicely placed geometric lines, ie, the diagonals of the Transamerica walls, next to the diagonal and vanishing point lines of the lights and boardwalk, as well as the horizontal lines of the building layers throughout the background, mesh very nicely here.

The treatment of the overall image as a black and white, with magenta and blue color spots lends an interesting feel to the image I think.  I think there are a few issues regarding lighting globally, particularly the skyline and boundaries of the Transamerica Building.  There appears to be a pretty sizeable area of 'globbiness' for lack of better terms, arouind the top of the pyramid. It looks a bit like a black halo.  Additionally there are a few remnants of color in the black and white 'rendering' that remain there. You'll find these on the upper portion of the slim building fragment peeking out around the large structure just below and to the left of the pyramid (Transamerica) building.  Also I think that overall, when taken as a whole, the detail areas, particularly in the black and white areas of the image, are a bit muddled and dull.  The color spots also look a bit too bright to me in comparison.     ",

  "general_impression": "Hi Ian, overall, this is a nice image to look at; Izaaks attention towards the viewer and his natural, relaxed pose brought a smile to my face, as I'm sure it would to viewers in general. There's some room for technical improvement, but nothing big, as a whole the image looks good as it is, and in a lot of cases the overall \"feel\" of the image, capturing the right moment and bringing across what you spotted when you took the shot is far more important than technical perfection.",
  "subject_of_photo": "Young children are great photo subjects, especially if you've got a personal bond with them. A lot of images that are very special to the person familiar with the subject become average or even boring to non familiar viewers, but in this case the attentive look in Izaaks eyes really make a connection with the viewer and make it more than an \"average\" shot.",
  "composition": "Placing Izaak off centre helps to create a more interesting composition. His blond hair strikes a good contrast with the blue metal behind it. I'm not very familiar with bikes, but I suspect the part of the bike showing on the right makes more sense to someone who knows what they're looking at.",
  "use_of_camera": "Even if young children are in the mood to pose, they tend to loose interest rather quickly, so you have to respond fast to capture the moment. Knowing your camera can mean the difference between capturing or missing a shot like this one; the fact that you got it, proves your camera isn't holding you back.",
  "depth_of_field": "Excellent, the short depth of field draws your attention towards the subject. The foreground on the right is a bit too sharp to my liking, but as I said earlier, if you know what bike parts you're looking at, it does serve a purpose to keep them sharp instead of blurring them with an even shorter depth of field.",
  "color_lighting": "Colors look natural, the blue parts, like you mentioned in your description, really add to the overall mood of the image. Some highlights (on the right of frame and part of Izaaks face) look a bit overexposed, but maybe there's some detail in the original file to pull out in post processing, it doesn't look completely bleached out. ",
  "focus": "The image looks like it has been resized in some way so I can't tell for sure, but focus seems the be just in front of Izaak, the front right of frame looks a bit sharper than Izaak himself. To fully draw you attention towards your main subject focus on the eyes helps, but I don't find it too distracting overall.",

Very good ambient light, very good moment and expressions, you can even make a fairy like narrative, and the post digital work is very well done.I only have reservations regarding the texture you used and the way you mixed it with the photograph. I do like to see textures on photographs but this is really hard to do very well. You did get away with it, to a certain extent, but the fact that it's wood and the scale is small doesn't help making the whole image a lot better. In fact because of the way you did it it's working more as foreground noise... and not really giving it the country like rustic look you were probably going for. The photograph certainly has it but it's not due to the wood texture on top of the left side and bottom, and this wood is making it a little obvious.Thank you for choosing me, it was a pleasure to analyze your work!",
  "subject_of_photo": "Excellent subject! Portraits of twins never cease to amaze and you did it in an untimely fashion with this classical swing. The background looks great and you captured them in a quasi renaissance angel style. The sibling on top was in a very ethereal natural and pose, away from the viewer, and the connection is made by the bottom sibling with her interrogated expression. You can almost trace a chart for their personalities.",
  "composition": "I have nothing to say about the perspective, there is a very nice sense of space here.Love the contrast!Regarding the composition, it's nice to have them dividing the space from one third on the right, having just the plane of the tree where the swing is suspended, and two thirds on the left, with the interlaced light and shadows from the tree leafs and the continuity of the forest with it's trees on the background.It does work having them this close to the edges but it's not that simple... In the first look I felt a bit compressed and went on the see closely and evaluate how close (right hand and head on top/feet on the bottom) they were to the border. There is almost no breathing space... Then I went back and took a deep look into it and the twins popped out of the picture, as if this was a window into the forest and they were in our side of the plane. It became unreal and many things crossed my mind, but then the bottom twin was looking to me, interrogated with my hesitation...Well done!",
  "use_of_camera": "I don't know if you shot RAW, TIFF of JPEG, but by the level of detain in the shadows and highlights seems this is a very well processed RAW. There is detail everywhere! They weren't swinging when you took the shot so the speed was not of the essence here and the aperture, probably the limit of the lens of very close to it, works fine.",

  "color_lighting": "The colour is also helping in giving this photograph it's ethereal feeling, which is a good thing, and the is also a good sense of vintage from it. It makes me remember some typical postcards of children from the eighties. It's a dream colour with its greens and yellows.The lighting is very good but I do find it to be a little pushed on the skin tone, mostly and specifically on the right leg and foot of the top twin. This also calls for my attention, due to it's very strong light emission, and do like it, but after contemplating it a wile longer it gets a bit to strong. This is slightly overdoing the aforementioned soft focus effect...",
  "focus": "The focus is on the spot. We never really can tell in these low res pictures but for what we can see it look to be exactly where it should.Some of the ethereal atmosphere is facilitated by a certain type of soft focus effect which I find a little bit imposing. Don't get me wrong, it looks great, I can't state this enough, but it looks a little over done. This is probably due to the light processing you did so enthusiastically well.They are very sharp, in a good way, you didn't overdo it, but it's strange to have such soft focus with very sharp edges...I'm giving you 9 because you accomplished this style very well.",

  "general_impression": "You have picked a nice subject, but the composition needs the diagonal lines you were hoping for , a crop to fill the frame, and a more interesting angle.  I feel the stark black is a little too dark for this delicate looking subject.  You need to move you flash off the camera and possibly use reflectors to get a more natural lighting feel rather than the flat and contrasted effect you now have. Even though contrast was part of your theme,  as the lights presently stands, it is not treating your subject to it full glory.  Some of the lighting can be fixed in post process, but it is much more fun to experiment \"on set\" with creative and unusual composition and  flattering lighting. ",
  "subject_of_photo": "You have picked a very good subject that has both interesting detail and color and an emotional connotation.  I like your theme of tranquility in the flower contrasted to the real world.  The use of a dark background supports this theme.  I would consider experimenting with a dark background with some colors that compliment the color pallet of the flower such as a deep brown, green, or plum. ",
  "composition": "The composition as is does not have the interest or uniqueness that is could - it needs some  tweaking, but I think you know this since you added the note of wanting a diagonal stem.  You are right that a diagonal stem coming from the lower left  met by the horizontal orientation of the flower would have drawn the viewer's eyes around the whole scene and fixed them on the foreground flower.  I would also suggest that the main flower be a bit more off center or the whole photo as is cropped so that the two flowers fill nearly all the frame (this would place it off center and in accordance with the rule of thirds).  Overall there is too much dark background.  To get really picky - the parts of flowers hidden behind the main flower are distracting and you should try to move so as to either cover them with the subject (the parts on the left) or make them part of the composition (the flower in profile on the right)  Incidentally, including the flower on the right that is a side shot would have made this composition include 3 different angles: front (almost), 3/4, and side - very interesting study of subject!",
  "use_of_camera": "You used a tripod which is the best technique with this type of subject and the exposure was such that it eliminated any movement from wind.  The black background is solidly dark and there are not blown whites or highlights. ",
  "depth_of_field": "There is a little bit of focus fall off in the stem and partial flower parts, but I would like to see more as this would soften the transition to the dark background and keep the center flower the center of attention.  Increased DOF would also help to vanish the partial flowers and make them less distracting. ",
  "color_lighting": "A bright flower popping out from the dark background would support your theme of contrast.  But it looks  like the mounted flash threw the light too high and missed part of the subject.  The reproductive parts of the main flower are not lighted enough and the lower half of the flower is too dark.  As an in the field wildlife photographer, my preference is to see lighting that looks natural. The background flower has a natural feel to it but the subject does not.  I would suggest placing the light off camera and high up from the side as if it were the sun in mid morning or mid afternoon.  I would then arrange a small fill light low under the camera to light just the inner flower parts.  This should introduce natural looking shadows with highlight the details such as spaces between the petals of the back flower and giving a natural and dimensional feel to composition.  Flash coming from the top of the camera is making this image too flat. ",
  "focus": "The focus seems to be on the petals of the center flower and the inner parts - which contain much more details of color and contract - are not in as sharp of focus.  My feeling is that these inner parts should have the focus as they are the most interesting and eye catching. ",

  "general_impression": "Hello Dustyn...My first impression was, way to go for getting up close and personal with that bug!  I really like the light, soft and angled enough to show definition in the little buggers features.  It does look like there is a young one, but I don't know the parenting habits of the Cicada.  It's either a youngster, or your big bug is about to have a meal.  There are a lot of interesting features of this photo, that would have all been made better with a little more attention on focus and position.  Look into macro photography if you have an interest in photographing insects! ",
  "subject_of_photo": "What you seem to have there is a Cicada. I believe out east, they live underground for 17 years and make an appearance.  Do they bring their babies with them?  From your title, \"Parenthood\" I am guessing there is a youngster under the head, but I'm not sure.  You would have to look that one up!  A+ for getting that close to an insect that was unfamiliar to you!",
  "composition": "It almost doesn't seem fair to critique composition and perspective on this one, it's not like you could move the bug...or could you?  Could you have changed your position? Here's why its a 6.  The tips of the legs are cut off on the left edge of the frame, if you are going to include all of the subject in your frame, be sure not to cut any of the edges, (fingers, toes, antennae)off.  With any living subject (with a face) its usually not a good idea to have the subjects eyes so close to the edge of your image, and if the eyes are that close, its better all around to have the subjects eyes looking into the image, not out of it.  Although the insect position is not quite right, I love the lines and the tones of the object he/she is sitting on that lead directly to the Cicada.  ",

The head and top of the body seem to have fine hairs that would have looked pretty darn cool if they were clear and sharp. Be very selective when choosing your focal point. The structure of the wings would have been really amazing focal point as well, but the angle and the light were a little off here so a good portion of the wing detail was lost.",

  "general_impression": "Hi Byron,And what a prince he is!  He's so handsome and the way he is leaning his head towards you with a twinkle in his eye is very captivating.  It must have been such a breathtaking moment to experience.  And you captured it with your camera.  Great job!",
  "subject_of_photo": "What a gorgeous young lion!  He looks very content resting under the tree.  Wonderful balance of your subject with his environment.",
  "composition": "His ears are on the top third horizontal line with his left ear on a power point.  Excellent choice of framing.  You left a good amount of space in front of him for him to be looking into the frame, again excellent.  You included enough of the background environment to give the viewer a sense of where he lives.  Both of his ears are forward facing with his eyes on you.  You are at eye level with him and there is a catch light in is left eye.  All wonderfully pleasing aspects.  I'm left wondering why you did not clone out the blades of grass in front of his face and touching his ear?  Byron, these are extremely distacting and take away from what otherwise is an excellent photograph.  You should clone out: the speck of dirt or bug under his right ear, the grass blade in front of his nose & whiskers (this is the most distracting element), the single grass blade in front of his left side that seams to touch his cheek, and the single blade in front of his left ear.  I would have rated composition a 10 if not for these distracting elements.",
  "use_of_camera": "Good choice using the 70-200mm lens.  It helped to create a shallower depth of field.  The photo looks to be slightly under exposed.  Since you were shooting in Aperture Priority and multi-segment metering, my suggestion would be to set your Exposure Compensation to +.3 or +.7.  Of course, you can also increase the exposure in post processing.At f/4.5 and Aperture Priority, you were getting 1/2000s shutter speed.  If that was the case thru the day, you could have lowered your ISO from 640 to at least 400, and maybe even 200.  The lower the better.  Even if the lion was jumping or running, 1/1000s shutter speed is sufficient to freeze the motion.  While I don't see any noise in your image, if you are going to print a large version of the photo, error on the side of using as low an ISO as possible to minimize noise.Personally, I would have used an aperture setting of f/6.3 or f/7.1 to put a little more of the grass around the lion in sharper focus.  By doing this, you would still have had plenty of shutter speed for the situation.",
  "depth_of_field": "The f/4.5 aperture works.  You may have gotten a better result with an f/6.3 or f/7.1, perhaps even f/8.  It appears there was plenty of space behind the lion to still create a soft background with a more stopped-down f-stop.",
  "color_lighting": "Color looks excellent.  White balance on Auto worked well for you.  Getting the catch light in his eye is magnificent, especially given it looks like it was overcast or shaded from the lack of shadows.  Nice even light, lucky you!  I would suggest reducing the brightness of the foreground along the bottom approximately 1/5 of the photo, specifically the dead grass blades, as this is distracting.  In addition, I would add a little warmth to the golden tones across the entire photo, brighten his face just slightly and put a very very subtle vignette in the photo.",
  "focus": "His face is tack sharp, you nailed it!  Great job!",

I would rather have the bird closer to the center, not too close but enough for the tail to be all in. The shapes are right, the tail is ending on the border in a sharp triangle and that's nice, but when I start thinking about the bird it get a bit mechanic. Also, the branch is a little too straight ans we have some bits of another branch on the right that can be somewhat distracting.",

  "general_impression": "Hi Winnie, this is technically well executed in terms of composition, lighting, camera use. The photograph does not quite deliver in terms of the message \"the juxtaposition of a pile of rubbish in the middle of a glamorous piazza after a fair\".  However I don't know the conditions you took this picture under-as a street photograph its technically very good. I find the juxtaposition of the British Lion & Unicorn on the building in the background with the contemporary foreground interesting as well",
  "subject_of_photo": "Contrasting peoples activity and aftermath can be interesting. I find my interest drawn to the McDonalds packaging on the right bottom of the frame rather than the rubbish in the centre. ",
  "composition": "The composition is very busy and certainly keeps my eye busy. Chair in the foreground suggests another story to the contrast of glamour & waste.The horizontal line of the kerb  helps to concentrate the viewers eye on the central area of the image. The wheel on left of frame suggests movement. The strong lines do help to guide your eye through the image.",
  "use_of_camera": "The camera has been kept level-important with photographs containing strong lines such as this. Exposure is good shadows not blocked highlights not blown. 1.3 second exposure-you have kept the camera static no tracking lines or camera shake.",

While it is a good idea not to photograph women \"square on\" her right shoulder is too straight on to the camera, and her left shoulder is completely lost. I suggest bringing her  left shoulder around into the frame more. Also the left hand is badly positioned on the wall, and looks \"disembodied\" (cut off from the rest of her body) which is not attractive.",
  "subject_of_photo": "The human subject (who looks familiar, incidentally) is worth a 10, but the brick wall is worth a 4, so I have split the difference!",
  "composition": "Because human beings are generally longer than they are wide, they usually suit the vertical format, unless you want to be creative with the space around them - such as when using the \"rule of thirds\" - and then the horizontal format works well. Unfortunately, you have given your subject a square frame, which results in showing almost as much of the wall as the subject and leaves unwanted space on either side of her. She is also far too close to the ugly wall, which has remained sharp and therefore is rendered in all its unattractive glory and detracts from the beauty of the subject.",

Use a few enhancements to play up these contrasts:  put contrast between the background (darken it) and the light  bird, pull contrast out of the range of dark and light in the bird's feathers and eyes. ",
  "subject_of_photo": "A beautiful bird that everyone likes see.  The combination of daylight, winter phase coloring, and in a man-made setting gives a feeling of this encounter being a rare event.  There is a story behind this - a story of contrast; nature and man, day and night (creature) .  You have all of the important stuff: eyes, overall shape, tail, beak,  The feet might be there too if you play with the contrast in that area. ",
  "composition": "Nice expression and eye contact!Ideally you would want to be at eye level with the subject, but that is not always possible.  This angle is not acceptable and the owl is making eye contact with you.  Also seeing a bit of the underside of the tail is interesting as a contrast to the smooth patterned feathers of the body.  The wire is a bit of a distraction, but the slight angle adds interest and is way better than a straight horizontal.  In post processing it might be possible to lighten the black a bit to make it softer and pop out less.  I would crop to a portrait orientation and try to eliminate some of the post.  That would make the image more about the owl and less about \" owl on a man-made object\" ",
  "use_of_camera": "you must have been pretty close to get this shot with that lens!  It seems that there was some possible digital zoom used ( the background contains some noise)  The movement has been frozen - the feather blowing in the wind looks rather sharp. ",
  "depth_of_field": "All of the elements are in the same plane so there is nothing but the sky to provide depth of field and either through depth of field or cloudy weather, the background is an even and neutral texture.  Perhaps there is a different angle from which to shoot this that would put some important elements in different plains and create more dimension in the image",
  "color_lighting": "The scene has a wintery monochrome theme but the camera has pulled some color in the bird which separates it from the background.  Ideally you want the neutral background like you have, but a slightly darker sky would serve as a contrasting color to the owl and made the owl stand out better.  To do this you could try a darker exposure and a flash or light reflector throwing onto the bird, but you run the risk of getting only one shot, the camera missing the shot, or the eyes showing the flash.  A directional light source would lend interest to the subject. ",
  "focus": "The focus looks right  and the eyes are sharp.  It is always a good enhancement to add contrast to the lights and darks in the eyes \"dodge and burn\"  to make them pop out as sharp and important. ",

  "general_impression": "Well Deborah: I think that your intention and your sensitivity regarding what the scene asked for a good photo were quite accurate. You felt that a tele-objective lens was correct and I agree. Don t be afraid to eliminate objects from the image! Move yourself, move around until the photo takes form by itself! (I always get amazed myself of how the simple fact of moving a few steps \"accommodates\" all the elements in the scene as a \"fine tuning\".)I think that you achieved to transmit the calm atmosphere of that little town, that looks like \"painted\" in that giant canvas that is the mountain behind. I would have just tried to move myself and try to separate more the little houses and trees for giving the image more order and clarity. The rest is very well done!",
  "subject_of_photo": "I think that there is an interesting theme in this photo, and it s that the mountain at background and the wall at foreground has the same angle of inclination. Also, it seems you used a large focal length, so the town seems to be \"compressed\" between the wall and mountain. The church also looks quite interesting as it seems to be flat, like a cardboard, from that point of view.But, there are maybe too many objects that distract me, so the main subjects of the photo lose strength, and the subject of the photo loses unity. (I ll be back to this in the composition matter)",
  "composition": "Well, I think that many times, in photography, LESS IS MORE. In this case, I think that the strong points of this photo is that you show little houses and church compressed between two equally angled surfaces (wall and mountain). So, I would recommend you always to ask yourself this: Which elements of the image I could eliminate without losing anything valuable? In this case, the left part of the image just brings confusion and dispersion. So, I would choose a square composition, cropping the left part of the image, and some of the right, following the limits of the wall (in the left)and the church (in the right) as guides for the cropping. By doing this, you will still keep the most important objects in the photo, and erase the useless ones.The tree is too big and is not very interesting (regarding light , texture, etc) but has a quite geometric shape, that cooperate with the straight lines of the wall/mountain and square shapes of houses, adding more richness to the general geometry of the image.",
  "use_of_camera": "I think I would have used a higher f number (more than F8) and a speed of about 1/100 sec (with some help maybe (a tick, a rock , etc where to steady the camera.)But it all depends on the zoom you used. It s possible that you noticed that with that focal lenght 1/300 sec was the best, and in that case, it s OK ;-)",
  "depth_of_field": "I think a closer f number would have been much better. This image asks for very sharp objects in all the image (in my opinion).",
  "color_lighting": "I think that the light was the weakest point... The dusk is usually great for making use of the artificial city lights in conjunction with the deep blue sky. If there are no artificial city lights, it would be better to shoot earlier, with the last sun rays, so you could have better textures in the wall, grass, tree, etc. In this photo, all is flat, so you have to use that in order to get a special atmosphere and a special look. The \"compression\" of the city between two flat surfaces is a very good way to compensate the lack of good modelling light. So, you did it well regarding this issue! The longest the focal length the better in this case. Color: I think the image needs more reds. You have blues, yellows and greens. Maybe some red/oranges would have helped to compensate and complement the greens.About the HDR treatment: You went too far! It s very noticeable, and doesn t help. (Look at the clear  circle around the tree! I think that a more moderate effect would have been much better.",
  "focus": "Looks like the focus is not that sharp in the background, which doesn t help much to the general composition of the \"compressed\" houses, which would look better with more sharpness.  ",

  "general_impression": "My general impression is quite good! You have done a good job here, trying to stand out but approaching the subject matter in an unusual way, and this is always good. I always congratulate the effort of going beyond boundaries. But in order to do this very successfully you need to pay attention the the smallest detail.With just a little tweaking this image is able to be much stronger and dramatic.Many times is good to be loose in the basic rules but in this case the image would benefit from strict rigidity, more so because you're already going astray from the main rules. But please do, please go astray and keep doing great images like this one!",
  "subject_of_photo": "Hi George,Your subject is very enjoyable and you've made it more interesting by keeping a large portion of the uninterrupted line on the first plane. Love the poles on the right! The vegetation on each side of the road and the fields on each side one darker than the other. On top of this there's a very nice mist you have made a bit stronger,  giving the shot a  stronger contrast from the middle to the edges.This is not an unusual shot though, it has been done over and over a million times, so it need to be perfect in order to hold it's own on the myriad of the already known without disappearing. But it's always a good exercise and I just love travel and road trip photography.",
  "composition": "This is where you could have made it stand out and in a way you did, by cropping the shot in an almost two squared rectangle. I've just tested it on my digital editor and it works much better if you radically center the fugue point making the painted line as vertical as possible wile keeping the background trees as horizontal as you can. Then cropping a bit further to get two exact squares, a top and a bottom one.It did wonders to the composition...We photographers generally follow a set of classical rules for composition, and this is not just in photography but in every framed representation of what we see and feel. But these rules are not to be followed blindly. In this case having the horizon in the exact middle of the frame it can work well for you.There is a thing you did here which gives this shot a bit more visibility from the sea of sameness of all the others, and this is the vertical panorama feel, which usually is done horizontal and I congratulate you for that. But than again, this would have work as I'm saying if you have made it perfect. By perfect I just mean finished in the scholastic sense, and that is to have it exactly aligned in the two squared rectangle.One last observation here.The fact that you framed (or cropped) this shot as you did is giving me a very strong and graphical relationship between the  road and the sky, and I do like that.",
  "use_of_camera": "Use of camera is good!",
  "depth_of_field": "Depth of field is exactly what you need to convey this type of imagistic effect. You could have closed your aperture a bit more till f11, I guess the D300 is able to go there without loosing any sharpness to diffraction. I'm assuming your F8 is in fact f8... a big F stands for focal distance, for the aperture we use a small f. This could never be an F8 image... unless you had cropped it insanely.It's hard to see the perfection of focus and DoF in these sizes... but I guess it would be even better with f11.",
  "color_lighting": "This black and white is well done but if it wasn't for the painted line on the road it would be devoided of any good contrast. There are some areas where I do enjoy the contrast and others where it gives me no pleasure.The contrast is good but it could be much better. I have to appraise you in one thing though, there is texture in every grey zone, from the highlights to the shadows. Well done!",

  "composition": "Composition and perspective are quite good with the white shirts leading a diagonal across the image.  What I dont like are the cluttered background areas, with spectators, chairs and water bottle.",
  "use_of_camera": "When using an automatic compact camera, creative ability is restricted and what you have here is a snapshot taken with a moderate wide angle lens, a moderate shutter speed and moderate f stop.  Fine if what you are seeking to produce is an average result but it will never allow you to produce a great picture.",
  "depth_of_field": "This is where the photograph falls down technically.  Everything from front to back is reasonably sharp but a shot like this needs to isolate the subject and to do this you have to use the equipment to suit what you are taking.   Ideally, a longer telephoto lens of 200mm or equivalent.  A fast shutter speed and wide aperture of f4 or 2.8   This will give terrific impact to the shot but focusing is critical.   It takes a lot of practice.  ",
  "color_lighting": "The image is rather flat and would benefit from slightly more exposure/brightness to lift the highlights",
  "focus": "Sharp across the image but that is due to the fairly wide angle of the lens and actually detracts from the overall visual impact.",

  "general_impression": "Hi Wayne, I think this is a great shot of a great species. It's well exposed, sharp on the subject and shows the heron in its natural environment. Well done.",
  "subject_of_photo": "Hi Wayne, thanks for choosing me to provide a critique. Strangely enough I've been photographing grey herons today myself so this is quite a timely critique! There is something about herons which I find fascinating!This is a great example too, it really shows the character and the nature of the species in a typical natural environment.",
  "composition": "It's a very central composition with the bird itself looking directly out of the frame. With a vertical type format I find this easier on the eye than it would be on a more horizontal format. When we view a photo like this we tend to look to the eye itself. Had this been a horizontal format I think it would have been let down by a central composition but it does work better vertically. Maybe a little more space for the heron to 'look into' would have improved the composition making it less central.",
  "use_of_camera": "What can I say? Shutter speed is spot on for the subject. It's very well exposed keeping detail in the brightest and darkest parts of the heron.",
  "depth_of_field": "With using shutter priority I am not sure if your camera has used your lenses widest aperture or not. The background is out of focus enough to help the subject stand out and the tack sharp features really draw the viewers eye straight to the heron's eye.",
  "color_lighting": "The photograph has been taken in good natural lighting conditions - a little sun but not too harsh. This level of natural light really helps bring out the natural colours of the species and it works well here.",

  "general_impression": "Hi John,  This is a very nice image not so much because the subject is compelling (which an elephant is), but more so because of the very subtle shades, tones hues and textures that are shared between Elephant and surroundings.  ",
  "subject_of_photo": "I like the subtle power, and ancient presence that elephants carry with them.  It always translates well in photos.  I realize that this is a zoo pic and its often hard to present an animal with any real sense of presence there, but in this case the elements work to your benefit.  ",
  "composition": "There weren't probably many vantage points from which to capture this image and I think that the composition is pretty good overall.  The movement here primarily goes to the vertical, and as such tends to take the eye from bottom to top rather than side to side or deep into the image.  This doesn't matter so much in this composition because the image doesn't suffer from any lack of depth (as the elephants head is partially inside the alcove in the rocks which presents a feeling of depth that wouldn't be there otherwise), or do the leading lines need to take your eye anywhere but the elephant. I think that the elephant fills up a nice portion of the frame, approximately 2/3 of the right hand side of the composition.  I think that his bottom left foot sits precariously close to the frame margin which could present framing issues later if you decide to print this one.  ",
  "use_of_camera": "I think the camera settings were okay, but at 115mm, and if shooting handheld, and if not using an IS or VR lens, your shutter speed (1/60th) may have been a bit slower than was optimal.  There is a liklihood of camera motion and thus blurring or focus issues that shutter speed.  The rule I like to use is to match your focal length number (115) with an equal or faster shutter speed denominator, example (1/125th of a second the '125' being the number to match or exceed the focal length number of 115.) I see you were shooting aperture priority so simply opening up your aperture from f/5 to say f/4.5 may have given you the shutter speed matchup.  ",
  "depth_of_field": "",
  "color_lighting": "The color and lighting on this image is its most compelling feature.  You said it was your intention to show the similarity between the elephant and its surroundings.  You have accomplished that well.  The colors, hues, textures and lines of the elephant mimic the same elements of the wall almost identically.  It was the first thing that came to my mind when I saw it.",
  "focus": "I see good focus on most of the elephants hide, which is good, but sense that it is a little soft around the eye area.  ",

  "general_impression": "Hi Robert, Thanks for sharing your image with me.  I like the feel of this photo as it portrays a simple insect as a real character.

I like your subject placed as it is in the lower third of the frame with a nice expanse of space in front and above him in which he, apparently, holds dominion.

I think the point of view works well here though it is pretty much at eye level and horizontal in its orientation.  ",

Either incorporate him into the image (the passive onlooker) or remove him from view by positioning yourself at a slightly different angle that doesn't compromise your angle with the sun.Ultimately, this is an excellent shot, taken at the right time of day with interest and action aplenty. Very well done indeed.",
  "subject_of_photo": "The idea of shooting a ladies game of baseball/softball adds a uniquely feminie perspective to a typically masculine sporting image. The drama of the action adds to the shot which was only possible thanks to your patience. Many congratulations are due on a number of levels.",

This is often the turning point of a game, and you've captured it extremely well. The positioning of the players also adds to the composition wonderfully well.",
  "use_of_camera": "A key element of good sports photography is being able to freeze the action (unless you are deliberately looking for blur of course). On this occassion, you've done that as well as stopping the sand as it sprays upward. If I could offer some advice, it would be to use a monopod or, if space allows, a tripod. By setting the ISO at 1200, you've been able to get the necessary shutter speed, which is vital. I prefer to use a support and drop down to a lower ISO value if possible to give lLess noise, smoother colours etc.",

Positioned on a horizontal third, it has enough space to catch the viewer's eye, but is close enough to the action to feel connected to it. You can almost hear the thud of the ball hitting the glove. If that wasn't enough, you've also got the players' expressions which show just how much effort is being exerted. Brilliant stuff.",

It would give more depth to the woman pushing the carriage and that sets up a more pleasing Rule-of-Thirds composition.",

Using matrix metering would have given you a broader range of tones to work with and would lave given a better balance between the shadow-tones of the trees and the brighter tones in the center of the image.

  "general_impression": "Very happy with this photograph. The composition and the exposure/contrast could have been better. Apart from that, you did very well in identifying and capturing a moment whose mood may well be irrelevant to actual events (man looking at funnels) but that manages to raise questions and feelings in the viewer. Why is this man looking at the boat? Why is the boat empty? Why is he alone? Why is he carrying that bag? What's in the bag? What's wrong with him? Where is he going? This is so sad! But it's also mysterious! and so on. I love pictures like this because regardless of the truth behind the events that were unfolding when you took the photo, you saw beyond that and that is what photography is all about. Your train of thought moved past actual events and you were able to portray your thoughts in the image instead of the actual events. You transferred your curiosity and your view of the world to whoever sees this picture. Perhaps live it was obvious what the man was doing and why, perhaps it wasn't. The point is that you took that moment and through one image raised questions and emotions. Your Description of the picture is what was actually happening. Your Title is the question in your mind when you saw what was happening. Your image is your attempt to transfer the title to the viewer. You succeeded and then some! Well done! ",
  "subject_of_photo": "I love this kind of subject matter. Interesting landscape with the human element discretely thrown in. Empty wharf. Empty port. Man standing alone. Wistful atmosphere. Love it.",
  "composition": "Your head-on, eye level perspective works very well. It transports the viewer there and makes them feel that they are actually seeing this. Concerning the composition. At first glance I would have thought that geometrically speaking the man would have been better discretely placed on the right of the picture with the door on the left and nothing in between. However, I think this would have lessened the importance of the human presence in the picture and taken away its dynamic, so well done on placing the man in the middle. One thing I would have changed if possible is the angle. A wider angle would have looked better if the door was not abruptly cut and the funnels were not right on the edge of the frame. It cuts the continuity of the image and leaves the viewer wanting. Also a wider angle would make the man look smaller in comparison to the boat and this would also build on the atmosphere that the picture conveys without distracting the viewer since it is sunset and the sky is nearly the same shade as the boat. If I couldn't get a wider angle I definitely would have cut some of the wharf to include more sky. The wharf with the tyre tracks and the geometric patterns of the tiles works well but the image would balance better with less wharf and more sky. More than anything it would give more emphasis of the man looking on, as the massive boat towers over him.",
  "use_of_camera": "Concerning camera use, one thing I would change is the contrast. In the Picture Style option where you set Monochrome you can adjust the contrast. Usually the default settings give pretty low contrast which is safe if you plan to post process your image. But having a great image straight from the camera is very satisfying and at the end of the day what you should be aiming for. Exposure and speed has let you down. I assume that since the door is open and the ship is so close to the wharf that the ship is not moving and the man is also static. You did not have to use such a fast speed and doing so has darkened your exposure. Not horribly, but half a stop or one stop higher would have provided better contrast and a clearer image. I still think that because of the subject matter the photo should be underexposed anyway. But not so much. An extra point on camera use: you could have opted for a faster speed but with a higher ISO rating. The graininess produced by the high ISO would again build on the atmosphere of the photo. With the 30D you don't want to go too high because the grains begin to form visible lines after a certain point. But I think you would be safe going up to 800.",
  "depth_of_field": "f8 good choice. The tyre tracks and geometric patterns on the wharf work with the flow of the image so you did well to keep them in focus and part of the overall picture.",
  "color_lighting": "The lighting works well in your favour. Half a stop darker sky would have been perfect but you can't control the position of the sun, clouds or the boat and if you had waited longer the man would have left and the contrast change between sky and boat would have probably been negligible. So well done on choice of time and lighting. Near perfect. Black and white... an awesome choice for this image. I honestly think that colour would have been horribly distracting and taken away a lot of the mood that b&w has given it. I am a fan of both colour photography and b&w and strongly believe that artistic photography works with both as long as you can choose which one suites the image best and in this case b&w is the definite choice.

  "general_impression": "Elena, overall I really like the picture. the way you used the lines and curves to move up into the stairs to the door moved me. The colors in this photo were wonderful. I think foot prints on the stairs would have made this photo awesome. The darkness in the middle was very distracting to me and I think you could have change that through cropping or changing the angle at which you shot, putting the line of the building and that dark portion in the middle of your photo would have made this photo much better. Good work. By the way I deleted two categories because I could not find anything to critique that would have been helpful",
  "subject_of_photo": "This is a very intriguing photograph. At first it gives you the appearance of two separate staircases going into a side by side. Studying the picture further you quickly determine it has to be two images one mirroring the other. The subject, winter, can not be detected because of the darkness of the photo. Seeing the uncovered air conditioners detract even more from the subject.I did find the photograph very engaging. It made me study the photograph to figure out what is actually going on here. There is an eeriness to the photo with the slight hint of color and the shadows. Feeling that I do not want to be here for fear of something going to happen. The staircase is very dominating in this photo taking my eye towards the doors. Unfortunately I find the dark center distracted and I think it detracts from the overall subject a winter mood in the city. I am going to assume this photo was edited after it was taken.  ",
  "composition": "I like the way you mirrored the stair case and their surroundings. I do not like the perspective as everything is to centered. The bottom of the brick and door way is right in the middle. Moving your camera up or down to move this line less center. The rule of thirds would apply here. Maybe lying in the ground shooting up and getting more of the building would have helped. I have no way of knowing if the mirroring of the image was planned or something you created later, but the title suggests differently. If you are trying to convey a feeling here about winter in the city you failed as there are to make thinks detracting from that, i.e. air conditioner for one. If it was a fresh  fallen snow than making foot prints on the steps would have been a good solution, than you would see the snow. I might have edited out the air conditioners to help as well.The other distraction is the dark center right in the center of the photograph. The eye wants to go there no matter how you look at the picture. Taking a shot from a different angle or even cropping to the rule of thirds could help.Depending on the time of day and if someone was home, seeing the outside light on the porch may have added a sense of city as we are always asked to leave our lights on. I am assuming your light source was the street light. Perhaps finding and angle that would have added some shadows could have also added more of a sense of city. I would have liked to see this photo from different angles, up down, through the wrought iron railings. As it stands the photo is very static.The staircase definitely adds depth to the photo as does the darkness. You feel like something is lurking in the shadows waiting for the unfortunate stranger.There are some wonderful lines in this photo the horizontal lines of the building and bricks, the squares and rectangles of the doors and the curvature of the wrought railings and the staircase. If you could have found a newspaper setting it at the door would be a nice touch. The angle with which the photo was taken could be improved upon, if mirroring of the image was the goal than it accomplished that, but it did not move me. I could not tell what the artist was trying to convey. As photographers we try to create the mood we felt when we took the picture. Again, adding things like the foot prints in the snow, the paper and shooting from different angles keeping in mind the rule of thirds could have helped with this picture. Finding some way to include shadows, maybe even yours would create a better sense of what we are looking at.I believe you did a nice job on contrast with light and dark. I like how the top of the doors and the building disappear into the darkness. This is where changing the angle could have helped, shooting up the staircase to the doors could have made the building look huge, like giants lived there, if you wanted to give that appearance. The muted red and greys create an eeriness like something is about to happen if you are not careful.The darkness is the middle is just to distracting for me maybe lighting it up more would make it less distracting  but not putting dead center could help even more here.One of the elements in the photo I would have like to see more of is the railing to the left of the staircase, again shooting from there would change the story but it may be even more interesting. The air conditioners creates a conflict for me, which would be good provided I could tell for sure it was winter.",
  "use_of_camera": "",
  "depth_of_field": "",
  "color_lighting": "I really like how you used the lighting and colors in this photo. The muted colors in the red brick and the yellow door bring just enough color to give the photo a littler life. It is a nice contrast to the varying colors of grey shown in the steps and the stone on the lower part of the building. I would have liked to see the gold of the porch light as it would have drawn your eye up the stairs and to the light and made the center darkness less distracting. The way you used the light makes the photo look very well balanced, but I feel creating a shadow may have made the photo more interesting.",
  "focus": "Your focus seems to be pretty uniform throughout the photograph. Nothing is crisp, not knowing what you used hurts me because you may not have been able to change that.  I would have liked to see the finial on the railing to be sharp focus with the door not as sharp. The muted tones help hide that nothing is in focus. Overall it likes clean, just not crisp. ",

  "general_impression": "Hi Nancy, nice job capturing the moment as that is most important. The subject's expression immediately connects with the viewer through the eyes. The challenges with this image are the lighting (harsh flash) and background (too cluttered and too close). In addition to watching for the right moment to take the shot, also look at different angles from which you can take the shot (to achieve a cleaner backdrop).",

  "composition": "The perspective works well; it appears you moved down somewhat to the subject's level which gives a more natural perspective. The mixture of light and dark tones beyond the subject makes the background cluttered and distracting. In particular the light tones in the top left and right corners draw attention away from the subject. A more uniform background that was further away (so that it could be more out of focus) would have been more effective. There is a lot of space on the left and right, a vertical format would have fit the shape of the subject better.",

  "general_impression": "Hi Krzysztof!Welcome and thanks for trusting in me to review your work. I hope you don't find me to hard on you and that what I tell you may help develop your vision and skills. On that note let me just start by saying that your skills seem to be good but maybe in need of more direction.What we see is the most important thing, if we have good skills we are able to show what we see better. In this case, besides the obvious approach to the sexy teacher shot, which is not so interesting for it has been done too much and she is not really there, she has too much foundation, specially around her lips. I always avoid to much foundation for it can be very observable if your lighting skills are good and yours are. You probably didn't do the make up yourself but this is your work and you should be on top of that. Also, the skin texture is a bit to waxed off on her forehead and around the eyes giving this a bit of a fake look just like you have on some magazines.I like the red and blue back-lighting here but am not sure it works well with this background. The way you used these lights seems like she is near an ambulance, police or fireman car, and this is not very consistent with her look.I really like the rendering of light and I even like the moire pattern effect on the shirt, but the softbox was maybe a bit strong and robbed you some of the magic from these back-lights.Really hope this is a helpful review!Cheers",

I can see exactly what you were trying to do, but with macro or rather close-up photography you need to get in there and show the detail, which lacks with this attempt. I gather that you utilized a wide open aperture to perfect your lighting (which you definitely achieved in this case), but you need lots of detail that will show all the creases and folds on the main flower petals. Try this again with a much higher aperture and really get into that flower. Use reflective surfaces to give you more light on the flower to assist.",

Then I realized it had been inverted and all made sense to me.  :)  I like the image and think that with a little additional work you could create a very interesting rendition of this work of art.",
  "subject_of_photo": "This is an interesting image notwithstanding any compositional issues, since the subject is an established and aesthetically pleasing form to begin with. The trick in capturing existing artwork is to provide the viewer with something that is different from the original pieces allure.  In this case you have opted to get creative with the presentation.  ",
  "composition": "I think aside from some minor crop issues the image is composed within the frame very well.  The isolation of the angel figure gives it a subtle power and a personal view that might otherwise be lost if we were to see the fountain in its entirety. The composition weighted, visually, slightly heavy to the right.  I think this is because the wing portion on the right of the angel is so large and takes up a lot of space to the right, and the angels face and body are relatively more close to the edge of the left frame.  Normally I like to see, in portraiture, or with human figures, particularly in motion (and although static, the angel is in motion) more open space in the composition in the direction of movement or the facing direction than to the rear. For some reason our brains seem to find that a more pleasing arrangement.  I like the diagonal that the angels profile has created in splitting the composition visually. ",

  "color_lighting": "I think the colors are much more interesting than as a straight photo. Inverted, the image does not immediately take on that 'negative' appearance that a more deeply saturated color image would have taken. The original image had a very monochromatic look to it, with a very washed out and uninteresting sky. Instead, as an inverted image, it takes on an other worldly, night time quality, and the orange and magenta tones lend it an ethereal quality.",
  "focus": "The image detail is soft, and while I usually am drawn to tack sharp images, the softness of the image in some ways is consistent with the flowing lines and texture of the statuary.  ",

This gives it some dynamic energy that it might not otherwise have.  Also catching the dog looking away is a much more effective way of engaging the viewer I think.  It creates more subtle mental inquiries than had he been looking directly at the viewer.  I think his feet are placed a little bit closer to the bottom of the image frame than I would like as it makes him feel less stable.  Should you wish to print this its likely you would lose some of the bottom of his paws to the matte or frame margin.  ",

It's possible sometimes to 'bring back' some of the detail in blown out highlights like this if you post-process your image with Photoshop or similar software especially if you shoot in raw mode.Shutter speed is good as the motion of the water has been stopped just enough.",

I think that ensuring that the foreground trees and the roadside nearest the viewer are sharp would make the image pop a little more, and even if it isn't possible to increase the depth of field, it would not harm the image for the trees farther back to be slightly soft. It might even increase the mysterious feel of the image if the background trees are slightly soft.",

Placing subjects on those points of power, makes it a much more stronger picture from a compositional point of view.The light spot of blue in the upper left corner is a bit distracting to the eye so I would have avoided that.The way you framed the picture, as if it was a panorama, is an excellent choice!",

I think you've succeeded well, whether that was your driving intent or not.  :)  I have a few suggestions to perhaps pop the image a bit and give you some options as to how you may want to ultimately present this. ",
  "subject_of_photo": "This is a very interesting image primarily because of the textural qualities of the component parts.  I think the dried, dead/dying stalks, tendrils and leaf from the crawling ivy. The nature of the composition in this instance, is less about the object which is the main subject, and more about the shape and texture of it and its wall and that of the space between them. I'm not sure about the angular stalk on the lower left, simply because it looks somewhat disconnected and askew. It emerges from the bottom of the screen, does a little dog leg then sort of 'almost' reaches the longer main tendril. But, then again, it is what it is and sometimes you take what you get in nature. I don't think it is a bad element. . just disconcerting to me.   ",
  "composition": "This is a flat perspective.  Shot straight on, I'm assuming on a stucco or plaster wall.  So there isn't going to be much depth, other than what shadow and form you can milk from the texture of the wall.  The shape of the stalks and leaf are rather static and do not flow fluidly, but that's not a criticism.  That lack of movement here is almost mournful and metaphorical, perhaps like a dried arrangement on a grave.  There is a bit of power in the cross shape of the stalks. I think the dried leaf in the upper right third of the image balances the otherwise straight and non organic lines nicely.  ",
  "use_of_camera": "I'll just comment to this extent.  I think this object may have been exposed 'correctly' but it is difficult to tell considering the filter treatment that has been applied. It appears to have been saturated, and perhaps sharpened as well.  I'm not sure, but there is a hard edged, gritty look to it that probably didn't come right out of the camera.  ",
  "depth_of_field": "",
  "color_lighting": "I like the look of this.  There is a lot of texture, spread equally througout this image.  The texture of the wall (way understated by the way and I'll talk to this later) along with the dried, crisp textures of the stalks and dried leaf, combined with the organic, pod like tendrils create a very interesting mood in this image.  And the colors red and orange are overblown to a degree that in this instance provide an over saturated surrealistic appearance to the image.  ",

I love color, but I think in this case it would have not been the best choice for this image as it would have competed with the form and line.  The monochromatic and almost Infrared treatment puts this in the category of a form study.  Nice.  Here's a few ideas for you.",

The impression of movement is created by the   jutting angle of the stack extending high into the deep black sky.  It is also a nice juxtaposition to have the smooth, manmade and stolid form of the stack rising  powerfully from the soft, organic foliage around it. I like the black solid and foreboding look of the sky.  And I also like that it balances out the lower right diagonal portion of the frame that is mostly detail and complex lines.  I feel as if there should be less sky on top of the composition, but I fear that if you cropped it too much you'd lose the sense of height that the image conveys.  ",
  "use_of_camera": "The settings here all worked well.  The only thing I would suggest is that whenever you can, and you have the latitude, shoot at ISO 100 to improve the level of noise you can get through processing or have a lot of blue sky to deal with.  ",

I don't use Lightroom but I know it's RAW processing functions exactly like Photoshop.  This has the surreal look of an old infrared photo. The lighting is nice and even and picks up the shadow formed by each individual brick margin, also the tree foliage is not blown out or overly bright.  I do think that you have an interesting cloud shape in the right side of the sky that you could emphasize to a greater degree and provide an additional visually appealing element into an otherwise featureless sky.

Unfortunately, and as I am sure you are aware, that branch is the blot on the landscape.As I said in the direct comments, if you could have moved your viewpoint so both eyes were visible I think you could have gotten away with it, but one eye being obscured lets the image down.Overall, you obviously know what you are doing with your camera, you need to visualise how the image will look as you shoot and be alert to how you can improve the compositional elements before you press the shutter.",

Exposure blending was well done, not sure if you used HDR software but if you did you were very gentle and did a good job controlling the dynamic range without introducing unwanted aberrations.  The trees as framing devices worked well.  All in all a very good image captured and brought to its best with some good post processing",

  "composition": "Used the gap in the trees as a good framing device for the mountain.  Theres a lot of \"pictures within a picture\" here.  Usually I would say to concentrate on the main subject of an image and not have the viewers eye wander all around, but in this case it works.  Theres lots of places to look and explore in this image.  You could have a variations here - a vertical portrait crop just in the middle part of the image. Cropping out right at the beginning of the red pine needles on the right and just to the left of the lighter tree trunks on the left..not instead of what you have here but in addition.  You placed yourself well to compose this image. I would just crop in vert slightly on the left hand side to eliminate that one dark trunk thats touching the edge.",
  "use_of_camera": "You made some good choices here.  Your super wide lens allowed for this wide and interesting composition, it increased the depth of field and because you didnt tip the camera up or down you have no apparent distortion with diverging trees etc.  Exposure at f8 was a good choice - probably the sharpest point on that lens and you bracketed to increase your dynamic range.  Tripod would really help here too but you still pulled it off.",

  "color_lighting": "The patch of blue in the sky is a little out of place and distracting.  The hue and saturation have shifted a little and it looks like there may be some slight haloing against the mountain.  I would slightly desaturate the blue so that so its not so different from the surrounded stormy clouds.  Leave a little just be subtle.  Lighting or exposure blends in the foreground and on the disappearing path are good.  Plenty of definition no blocked up shadows or blown out highlights.  ",

  "general_impression": "Hi Maureen, Overall I think this is a great composition, and there is a lot of potential here in terms of movement, color, lighting and drama. But I think that your foreground shadow areas suffered from being just a bit too underexposed.  I think if you had the same exposure and foreground flowers as in your first attempt with this image a month or two ago, this would have been perfect.  As it is its very nice.  It is, however, going to be difficult, considering the huge tonal range you are trying to accommodate, to get this image exactly where you want it in terms of exposure and color balance.",
  "subject_of_photo": "I like this subject as much as I did the first time I saw this scene (a similar one from a different perspective).  There are many interesting facets to this image.  The road and fence work well together here and are iconic features that help to create a very nice mood throughout the composition.  ",
  "composition": "I think you got it right in this perspective and view. As I recall your last shot of this bridge and landscape, as beautiful as it was, was not nearly as powerful as this one in regard to the design elements, flow, and dynamic fluidity.  I very much like that your road, and fenceline begins on the far left corner of the frame, movers diagonally back curving to the right, and then swings nicely back to the left abd upwards at a diagonal and disappears into the background near the upper left quadrant of the image.  That motion is both subtle and dramatic at the same time.  it also very successfully makes your eye move throughout the composition and takes it on a tour of the entire image.  Sometimes a photo has such a compelling element that the viewer can get hung up in one area of the frame and not feel the power of the entire image.  That is not true here.  The large fence posts in the foreground that diminish in size define the scale of the scene very well, and provide some framing that is pleasing to the eye as well.  I like too, how the entire scene seems to diverge into the upper third of the image.  A nice classically balanced composition.  Great job.",
  "use_of_camera": "Looking at the original data for the file (thank you for providing it), it appears that this image was originally captured as a raw file, so the exposure settings become less critical.  But they are important in that even though you have a greater amount of latitude with a RAW file in terms of pixel information to work with, you still have to be cog                                  ",
  "depth_of_field": "Good",
  "color_lighting": "Since you have indicated that it was your intention to render this image as not faithful to the original color balance I won't critique it as if you were.  To my taste I think there is just a bit too much magenta.  I don't know if that is the hue you wanted to have as your main overall tone. I do like the rather ink and water color wash effect that the image has.  I think however that some additional contrast, saturation and additional dodge and burn efforts could improve this image a bit.  There is a slight whitish halo around the tree group that resides in the center of the image on the horizon line.  I think this is simply a bit of overexposure of highlights.  I also feel a bit uncomfortable with the color combination of a salmon colored sky with a cyan/magenta foreground. I feel too that the lighting is a bit flat here, and as a result it looks a bit washed out.  I think the coloration and the treatment in post processing is partly to blame, but the foreground detail and tonal values are going to be difficult considering how dark the original image was in that area.

  "composition": "I think the composition is pretty good and contains all many elements that help to draw the eye into the frame and to maintain its cohesiveness throughout.  I like that you captured some sand, water, horizon and sky, as well as framing it up with a couple of nice lush trees.  It certainly focuses the eye and draws in into the central heart of the image and into the distance. I don't think the trees however lush and green they are, should be dominating so much of the frame however.  They do serve as a nice frame but they have a tendency, due to their size and prominence in the frame margins to cry out for more attention than they may deserve.  I think the heart of this image is the layered water hues and the interesting clouds as well as the horizon imagery.  The trees in this case, while they do focus the eye, and frame the image, do so to a little bit of a detriment.  I also think The horizon is placed well, but I would have liked, I think, to see just a little more of the sand in the foreground for balance.  ",
  "use_of_camera": "I think your settings were pretty good and the fact you used a tripod even better.  I'm a bit chagrined that despite the small aperture f/14, the image appears soft at the horizon.  I'm thinking that because the trees were close to you the DOF was shortened considerably as you concentrated your focus on the trees.  Nonetheless I think your exposure was pretty good, but a look at your histogram shows some blocked shadows and some blown highlights.  Not huge swatches of area but probably in the tree shadows, and blowouts in the sand spit on the bottom of the frame where you've lost texture and detail.  ",
  "depth_of_field": "I think the DOF needs to be reversed.  I sense hypersharpness in the tree frame and a soft horizon. I don't think that works well for this sort of landscape where your framing is highlighting and drawing attention to the background.  ",
  "color_lighting": "I do love the colors and mood of this image.  I think there are some dark areas that could be brought out, specifically the landforms on the horizon line and some of the shadow detail in the tree.  Conversely there are some areas in the sand in the foreground that you can adjust down to bring back some of the highlight detail that is now subtly blown out.  ",
  "focus": "I think the foreground trees are nicely focused but I'm seeing a bit of softness in the horizon and sky.  I am not sure whether this is from a shallow focus or from simply the compaction of the image through size reduction for presentation here.  But to me the trees are way sharper than the horizon images.  On a landscape like this I would want to see a sharpness extended to the horizon with a perhaps softer (not blurred) focus on the framing trees.  Just my thoughts.",

In all aspects I feel you created a very nice photo of a beautiful subject.  And you mentioned you just \"happened\" by and made a quick snap of it.  That's good.  I'm a firm believer that many of the best and most personally rewarding photos are ones we don't over think, but instead follow our intuition and simply act upon.  It doesn't have to be a super controlled, super setup photo in order to be a successful one.  Many of the best are very simple and genuine.  Keep following your intuition when out shooting!",
  "subject_of_photo": "Jane,I can see why you stopped for a photo here!  The color and shape of these flowers are eye-catching!  A perfect subject for your lens. Flowers make such great photo subjects and you've done a terrific job of highlighting one of them (opened up) but kept enough of it's surrounding environment to provide context and support!",
  "composition": "I love the  way you've composed this photo and the perspective you've selected!  First the composition - you've placed the main flower (opened up) off center, slightly up and right of center.  The other blooms on the lower left are a perfect leading line that brings the viewers eyes up to the main flower.  I love the way you've framed the corners with a partial bloom on upper left, foliage on upper right and it looks like a stone or wood on lower right.  These elements keep the viewer in the frame and redirect the eyes back to your main bloom.  The perspective - Love it! The inside of this flower is absolutely beautiful and you've highlighted that.  I can easily see all the details inside from the perspective you've selected and it \"feels\" like a normal and comfortable angle.",
  "use_of_camera": "Your use of exposure controls here worked wonderfully.  Shutter speed was fast enough to avoid subject and/or camera movement, aperture selected kept areas other than critical focus somewhat soft.  Overall exposure  looks great.  Nice tonal range. ",
  "depth_of_field": "In my opinion the depth of field is perfect here.  Shallow enough to let the background fall off somewhat, but deep enough to keep some definition and recognizably to the background and surrounding elements!",
  "color_lighting": "I love the color play here!  The red, white and yellow of the flower stand out while the green foliage complements it and provides a soft, low key border for the flower.  Lighting is wonderful!  Soft, but with enough direction and contrast to create dimension and depth to your shot. Very nice! ",
  "focus": "Focus looks terrific!  You've keyed in on a select, specific portion of your main subject and allowed the surrounding areas to go slightly soft.  This helps assure my attention is directed to and stays on your main subject.  Nicely done!",

  "composition": "Your choice of subject and your reasoning are very good. However, you have not shown this in your result. Your friend has gripping eyes and, from what I can see from the stone, it has a variety of texture and colours, all of which are largely lost. Choose whether you want to emphasise your subject's facial feature or if you want to include her body too. Above bust cuts are for passport photos so try to avoid them. They're not close enough to be drawn into the face nor far enough to enjoy the rest. Also, you have tightly cropped just above her hair. It would work better if you left a little air on top to \"frame\" your image. Concerning the stone I think I would have like to see more of it or be closer so I could see more detail. So Essentially what you would be aiming to do is move closer to the stone, and (my personal choice) closer to your subject. It would give a fade-in / fade-out effect using the stone, with your subject in the centre and her eyes would really grip you. Also, as she would have to turn her head more to the right it would take care of the light hitting her nose too.",

I would need to be lying down in the grass on a sunny summer afternoon then I could just lay in the shade and enjoy the wonderful lines of the branches and the beautiful light on the leaves. I like the fact that there is a natural curve on the left side of the image, created by the pale coloured leaves (or are they small flowers?), which helps to contain the movement of the eye within the image. Nicely shot!",
  "use_of_camera": "Auto white balance is usually ok but I would say the colours were on the cool side here. Maybe consider using a warming filter in Photoshop? ISO 100 is good for bringing out the detail and 1/170 sec is fine for a handheld shot on a bright day. Focal length is good for including as much as possible within the picture frame and for maximising the available light. So good job over all.",

  "general_impression": "George overall  your photograph got my attention immediately , thus it has the impact needed to be a very good landscape  photograph , The angle and f  stop and subject matter pull your image together . The  correlating sky clouds and the salt  pocket ridges have a great pattern, which produced  this final image, Well done !! Good impact !  ",
  "subject_of_photo": "Hello George ! Yes the dead sea is a fascinating  area on our planet. Great angle in capturing this photograph, The pockets of salt water and ridges create a puzzle effect that stretches as far to the edge of the distance mountains, The Green of the salt water and the ridges yellowish red make it look like  you could be on another planet. They transfix your eyes with wonder as your eyes wonder over the bottom half. ",
  "composition": "compositionally George, this does transpire very well as a golden ratio, with the lens angle and the pockets of salt water and ridges draw your eye in a diagonal line to the center. The image is split into two by the mountain range which to me works, because the sky  with the clouds pattern balances off and mimic's the pattern on the lower half salt pockets. However George the clouds lack some contrast  especially in the lower portions to the right side,they could be adjusted in adobe or lightroom or another similar Photoshop. However sometimes I know the clouds are like that at lower levels.",
  "use_of_camera": "All settings that you  have  used George are great, ISO 200 , 1/160 and f 13, however you could have dragged the shutter speed by one or two stops, this would have added a little more density over all to the Photograph, meaning center balance by the meter, then drop the  shutter speed under exposing it thus giving  the added density. ",
  "depth_of_field": "Great at  F 13 !",
  "color_lighting": "as mentioned above George, or you could get similar results by adding the density selectively  in a photoshop, and  only by  a little amount within reason , just enough to give it some snap.",

There are many incarnations of this building and it is up to the viewer to bring it alive in their imagination.",

I think there is something primal and compelling to us as humans that time of day.  Perhaps its the quality of light or the promise of something new and exciting. At any rate I think you have captured the mood of the moment in this image. I like the texture and structure of the clouds.  ",
  "composition": "I think the composition of this image is for the most part pleasing and balanced. There is a fairly flat perspective to this image and it presents, because of a minimal number of leading lines or diagonals and s-curves, a pleasing but less dynamic image as a result. The tree trunk, while performing the role of providing perspective and some framing, takes up nearly a third of the image and thus dominates more than it should perhaps.  Considering it is in shadow with little or no detail, it provides only reference for distance.  I think a judicious cropping of some of that black area would help balance this image some.",
  "use_of_camera": "The exposure on this camera works, considering you were not using a tripod.  Even at 1/600th of a second you were still shooting with a wide open aperture.  Since your focus was pretty much at infinity, this wasn't an issue.  Had there been more shadow detail in the tree that you were trying to capture then it might have been considering your depth of field would have been diminished substantially.  But this exposure and speed was fine to capture what it was you were trying for. .and I assume that would have been the sky, clouds, soft colors and water reflections for the most part.  ",

If we're open and able to adjust to something we can take hold of it.If we consider this is an iPhone shot there isn't much we can expect regarding the regulation mechanisms of the camera. It's pretty limited...I like the fact that you didn't waist to much time to make the shot, capturing the butterfly quickly before it could fly away. That is, I'm guessing you did it like that. It's possible that the butterfly stayed longer on your finger giving you the chance to shoot more and search for the best angle.You say this is nature photography but what I see is a butterfly in what looks like an urban environment where everything is man made.I do like the angle on the butterfly if the head and antennas is the goal and in that regar the focus is well done. But it's not very clear what your goal is here... It could just be a quick shot to catch the wonderful butterfly that happened to be resting on the finger.Looking forward to what you'd do with 'nature photography' after these comments.Cheers!",

  "general_impression": "Hi Robert,This is a lovely shot. I think the form of the bird is interesting, more artistic than ornithological though. For an ornithological shot I think you would need to show the form more clearly and also the beak. But I love the plumage, the flowers and the general look and feel (it's quite tactile) of the shot.",
  "subject_of_photo": "What a beautiful bird, spectacular colours and glossy plumage - a lovely subject for a photo especially with the soft eucalyptus trees in the background as a setting. Definitely a good subject for a photo.",
  "composition": "The composition is good and I love the fact that the bird is upside down. My only tiny criticism is that I would have like to have seen his entire beak which is specialised for breaking open seeds. But you've left lots space around the bird which I like, and also cropped to a square format to get rid of extraneous elements which works well too. ",
  "use_of_camera": "A shutter speed of 1/500 is the minimum you need to shoot at if you have a focal length of 500. But the image looks sharp so your choice seems to be good enough. Also the exposure is good. Well done for using manual settings. Spot metering was a good choice.ISO of 200 was also a good choice for wildlife as it is slow enough for good detail and low noise at the same time.My only criticism is that the photo is 1113 pixels on the longest side which is quite small and I assume that you have cropped a small area out of a larger image. It looks fine if it's only for web usage but it's too small for exhibiting or printing as fine art.",
  "depth_of_field": "I like the way the eucalyptus flowers are sharp in the foreground and blurred in the background so I think the depth-of-field is good. Perhaps with a one-stop larger of f 5.6 you could have added a bit more blur to the mid ground and freed up one stop extra to shoot at 1/1000 th of a second to be on the safe side. I'm probably being a bit picky here though! ",

Excellent piece of art Kris !!!!!",
  "subject_of_photo": "Kris, another outstanding  photograph ! The timing is actually  just right in my view the  yellow leaves on the trees at the top center with the leaves on the rocks still hold  this autumn image in full swing.  tranquil and nature showing her best at this time of year is well displayed by your Photograph with the falls flowing out at the #1 position down through the # 3 position and exiting out at the right bottom, beautiful flow sequence!!  ",
  "composition": "As mentioned the   falls flow in thirds and Triangulation is also in play here, there is also a touch of golden spiral in reverse when applied over the image.  very good contrast, depth of field by the rocks on the left to the rocks on the right and gives the depth  some punch.  the dead wood  really assists in helping the water flow exit from the photograph, which is a must in a superior image, to  have  a flow in and flow out.  Very well framed  leaving ample room around  the falls in include the surrounding rock and leave combo.",
  "use_of_camera": "All setting executed perfectly  even the long exposure of 2.5 sec and three images hdr's still leaves details in the water flow , to often I see water flow images where the  exposure in long and the water detail is missing. this leaves the water  washed out and  looks like a white out  and in terms of quality the image fails.

I would look for more interesting weather or wait for some bird life to enter the scene, something is missing I feel but the panoramic idea is a good one and I think you should explore it further.",
  "subject_of_photo": "The coast is a great place to go to make some panoramic shots and with your SLT-A33 I think you made a good choice of subject although I think the time of day and the weather conditions were not ideal.",
  "composition": "I find the composition a little dull - sorry to be blunt! - and I think it could have been improved with a more interesting sky, say 50 per cent clouds and 50 per cent blue. I like the sloping land mass on the left but the rocks in the water leave me a bit indifferent.",
  "use_of_camera": "The use of 0.8 seconds means that the waves are a soft blur which is a nice feature but I think you could have made more of it. If you had used a tripod you could have chosen an even slower shutter speed and created a misty effect in the sea area. Even with a shutter speed of 0.8 you need a tripod though otherwise parts of the image will not be totally sharp. It's not possible to hand-hold a camera and expect sharpness through at less than 1/30th of a second or maybe 1/15th at a push - and that's with experience!Also, ISO 100 is quite low and I think something like 320 or 400 would have been better. The light is low so you need to choose an ISO which will maximise the light while still retaining the minimum level of digital noise (grain). ",
  "depth_of_field": "I think the depth-of-field is good as it goes to a soft blur in the background giving a sense of distance. This is because an f stop of 5.6 is fairly large so that only the foreground and middle ground are sharp. An f stop of f/16 or f/22 would have made the background sharp too.",
  "color_lighting": "The colours are very cold and I am assuming the White Balance was set to Daylight (as you set it yourself manually). You can set the White Balance to Cloudy to warm up the colours a bit (yes, even when there are no clouds!). Or try applying some photo filters in post-processing to subtly alter the colours a little. As it stands, the colours are quite hard and cold which personally I find unappealing.",

  "general_impression": "Hi David,The first thing I noticed was your watermark, which is very prominent and disturbing. It's hard to appreciate the photograph with it on top and as opaque as it is. I started by looking at the baby's eyes but the watermark is so strong in peripheral vision that it took me away from your subject. Then, having rationalized the watermark I was able to see what matters.The baby's expression is great, you really caught the moment there! The parents on the background look a bit forced into a pose, but the mom is so happy that it doesn't really feel wrong.Having this slight percentage of colour I feel the need to see it in natural colour. It could also work great in black & white.There is reflected light on the right side of the baby's face but the eyes is unrealisticly shadowed. There are also a few other problems that I will address directly in my suggestions for improvement.Nevertheless, I this the end result, not considering the effect on top of it and the way you edited this shot, you have a really nice portrait of the baby! It was caught in the perfect momento for the expression and I'm sure you'll be doing a lot of other great shots like that!Cheers",

What is right here is that the \"horizon\" ; the place where the grass meets the trees, cuts below the subject matter (the head) it could be bisecting the deer a little lower - like at the chest- but it is not too bad where it is.

  "focus": "Unfortunately the face is not sharp.  This is most likely due to motion blur.  Try a monopod.  When hand holding, keep your elbows close to your body and hold your breath, have your feet slightly apart and knees slightly bent for stability.  If this is due to the deer moving your will need to  use the sports mode which will make the shutter faster to eliminate motion blur.  Also try one of the setting for lower light - sunset  (maybe) or the anti blur mode.  Your manual might better explain the modes.  If the subject is too far away for the zoom, progressively get move closer slowly over several minutes and do this each day until you are able to get much closer.  You can even construct a blind or use a car or tractor.  It should adjust to the change quickly and you can even move the blind closer over time. ",

Animals don't always like the intrusiveness of a camera lens pointed towards them so perhaps the cat is trying to say something! Either way, the expression on an animal's face is always an interesting subject for a photo.",
  "composition": "I like the cropping of the image to square format. This eliminates potentially distracting elements and forces the eye to concentrate on the main subject. However, I find the dandelion leaves in the background really distracting, especially as they appear to be radiating out from the cat's head. Also, the white stone object in the top right of the image is very bright and also a bit distracting.",
  "use_of_camera": "Exposure time of 1/25 sec is actually quite slow, especially if it is a handheld shot. It is possible to avoid camera shake at this speed but it needs a fair bit of practice and I think that overall this photo could have been sharper. Also, by choosing a faster shutter speed, you would have to open the aperture more which would have made the background more blurry. Decreasing the ISO to 100 would also have meant that you could open the aperture more (to compensate) and increased background blur.",
  "depth_of_field": "F8 will give you lots of detail in the background so a bigger aperture (smaller f number) might have been a better choice. ",
  "color_lighting": "I like the lighting - there is some shadow but it is not harsh and the shadow areas are unobtrusive. The colour balance seems natural and I think your choice of 'Shade' in the White Balance menu was a good one. It seems to have brought out the beautiful colours of the fur - fabulous!",
  "focus": "I see you have used manual focussing and it looks to be focussed on the eye of the cat, exactly where it should be.  If you had shot using auto focus the camera software would have selected the foreground leg as being nearest the lens which would perhaps have left the eye out of focus. So well done!",

Before my eye was dropping off at the base of the photo, wondering what was there. This is a nice addition for me!",
  "use_of_camera": "Once again I am concerned about the depth & seperation of background & subject. My 22 years of on the job training & 6 years of photography schooling tell me the speed should of been slower and the aperature opening smaller. I feel strongly that this exposure & speed contribute to the lack of depth, seperation and the flatness of the subject. Not much but just a little bit.",

  "general_impression": "HiThe first thing which I noticed in this photograph were the paws on the ledge. I really liked this and their position works well with the composition.There are a few areas I think which could have improved this photograph. Now I know you cannot go back and retake the photograph so they are a few points to consider in the future. Also, it is quite useful for us to see the camera settings in more detail - although you giving this information doesn't change the photograph it certainly helps us offer guidance. Thanks for submitting the photograph and I look forward to seeing more of your work in the future. ",
  "subject_of_photo": "Hi, this is an interesting subject for me to look at! I've never seen a raccoon, not even in captivity. We don't get them in the wild over here in England. I like the mix of subject and surrounding habitat - it provides a good balance.  You've managed to photograph an interesting moment too as she balances herself with her front paws on the ledge.",
  "composition": "Wherever it is possible I am a great believer in the photographic benefits of getting low down to your subjects own eye level. It allows much more creativity in using depth of field to try and isolate your subject against the surroundings. The foliage in the bottom right of the frame is a little distracting too. In terms of the raccoon I like how the main body is not too central and there is a little room to the right of the frame.",
  "use_of_camera": "You haven't included the data pertaining to aperture/shutter speed / iso focal length etc. Maybe you could have increased the contrast and clarity on your subject if you had positioned yourself lower. This way I think the tops of the leaves wouldn't as prominent and reflecting the light. Not only is this quite distracting to the eye but I think it has caused your camera's meter to try and expose too much for the brighter elements which has left the main subject a little darker.",
  "depth_of_field": "I'm not sure how you had your camera set up as the information isn't included. Whatever aperture you chose to use was certainly sufficient to cover the whole of your subject.",
  "color_lighting": "The light is quite harsh and it reflects off the top of the leaves which is quite distracting. As I mentioned above, getting down lower may have alleviated this as a distraction.",

This was a simple fix and needed to be done. Bottom and top are good but l/r is weak. Secondly, the image is tilted. Baseball is played on level ground and rail posts are vertical. It's a rare occurrence when verticals and horizontals can be left askew. This is not one of them. Even if you don't agree, at least try what I'm suggesting and see if you feel differently about this image.",
  "use_of_camera": "The only thing I would change is to never use center-weighted average metering mode again. There isn't a single pro I know that uses this mode as it is prone to light measuring mistakes and that's exactly what you have here. I'd say this image is at least 1.5 stops under exposed. It's also a bit muddy but that's best left for another section. Spot or matrix/evaluative are best, especially in these types of environments.",
  "depth_of_field": "Perfect.",
  "color_lighting": "Except for the under exposure, muddy contrast, green skin tones and overall dark feel, it's great!

Love the ambiguity on this one, it not only lives up to the title but is also quite ambiguous regarding what is that you're shooting. I'm seeing a tree upside down, but this could very well be a detail of a sculpture. Very interesting! The thin bark that becomes metal and gets back to be bark again. Very nice concept.The result isn't a pleasing images as the other were, so this would probably work well in an installation but alone, like this, it's a bit lost, not grounding itself enough for me. Anyway, even that get's to be interesting. Well done!The rating didn't get as high as the last two, but this way you know that I won't just flatter you with praise. I will be as honest as I can be, always, even if that means that you prefer to work with someone else. I think you understand that and hope that you value it.You're intriguing me by the hour, sincerely looking forward for the next!Cheers",

  "general_impression": "Hi Shankha,I'm hoping you don't take this the wrong way, but I'm not very impressed with this result. I know you can do much better. Maybe it's time to invest on a good monitor, because will your previous shot was quite good, it was not as hard to do as this one, and for something like this to work well you should have at least a medium quality monitor like the Cinema Display.I'm not sure you should be trying to keep on developing this RAW file just yet, maybe you could benefit from starting with easier shots. But if you love this one you can go back to it once you're secure in your RAW developing abilities.I sure have no doubt that you'll be doing it quite well very soon. I'm sorry for not giving you a nice critique to read but I guess you're here for learning and not for flattery. As I said before I'll be glad to help you on this journey but wile this may be pleasant at times it can be a bit frustrating for you, because it's not an easy road to walk on.Having said all this, I hope you understand and see it as the best possible position for me in order to help you get better at this and be a great photographer. At least you know that when I'm praising your work it will be in a very honest way.See you soon!Cheers",

  "composition": "I have to say this composition really lacking in attitude and the objective is not that clear. Having saw the previous shot I can see more to it, but this should work well standing alone.Besides not having a particularly interesting composition, the horizon is a bit tilted.",
  "use_of_camera": "Good that you're shooting RAW, this way you can go back and redo the processing/development of your digital negative.

  "color_lighting": "This lighting is nice but very hard to work with. The highlights are good but a bit overexposed and the shadows are quite dark so for them to be as clear as they are hear you had to compromise the contrast a lot.These shadows are very far from convincing and you can see they very well by observing the natural contrast that you have on the top left corner after the yellow bit of the rim up there. That shadow is up there, it has a lot more light on it, and it's much darker than the shadows on the bottom of the valley.The colour is not very pleasing here, it's too much magenta and the rim on the background is going on pink. I know this is a sunset and can imagine that they get magenta and pink there, but this is a bit to much to work. I like the colour saturation though, it's not to excessive, but it would perhaps work better with a little less of it.",

The position of the bird id interesting, but not unique.  A view of the tail would have elevated the composition as this breed's tail is quite nice and interesting.

The only thing that bothers me is the shadow across the breast created by the neck and the direction of the sun.  A very carefully configured fill light would have solved this, but I doubt the bird would have sat through trial and error to get it right.  You might choose to reduce the impact in post production by \"opening up \" that shadow with a spot exposure adjustment.",

Mostly because you chose to make a very specific portrait of a sub culture and that is quite interesting, but I also enjoy the vaudeville and gothic subgenres. The compass is a very nice detail here! I also like the parasol, of course, but it could be more interesting if you had given more space to the parasol, creating an even greater contrast with her pure white skin.I would seriously love to see more of this shoot if you have more, or of other shoot you might have or might be doing in the future.See you soon!Cheers",
  "subject_of_photo": "Portraits of people are always a good subject but always a hard one. In this case we have a very specific subject and that helps in making it more interesting. It's always interesting to see alternative styles!",

Regarding the composition for me it's a bit tight, I'd like to see more of the parasol and the corset, mainly the corset that seems to be quite nice and we can only see a very little bit. Also, her left hand small finger is calling for a bit of breathing space on the bottom.Other than that you have a quite nice composition of shapes.",
  "use_of_camera": "I'm guessing you shot this in aperture priority, so it's an auto and not really a fully conscious exposure decision. I would say that you needed a little more exposure to get more out of the eyes. Maybe just one stop. But overall it's quite good, no losses in the highlights and shadows.",

  "depth_of_field": "With f/22 the depth of field should be quite deep but the mist has largely restricted the depth-of-field to create a fairly shallow field of focus in the foreground.

I would have cropped the top section where the aqua sky hits the orange clouds. By cropping there is a little more impact on the main focus of this image. I also like the perspective which is a little high. Are you standing on a hill or bridge?",

  "general_impression": "Ana, overall this is a nice photo. The use of the long lens to blur the background and the composition of the head in the upper left corner all work well. The closeness of the crop is the only challenge for me here.",
  "subject_of_photo": "This is a beautiful owl. The position on the branch or bush provides a nice context for the bird.",
  "composition": "The only real challenge for me in this image is how closely cropped the composition is. The head is too close to the frame and the tail feathers seem cropped off. ",
  "use_of_camera": "You have plenty of shutter speed to insure no movement, the image seems very well exposed. You could have sacrificed some shutter speed to increase depth of field.",
  "depth_of_field": "I don't mind some of the feathers near tail being somewhat out of focus. You will never get it all in focus with this long a lens, however, I would have changed my f-stop to f11 or so to increase more depth of field. Since you were at f7.1 - 1/500 you could have moved ISO to 800 and stopped down f stop to f11 and still had plenty of shutter speed to stop movement.",
  "color_lighting": "The blurred background is excellent. The eye focuses on the bird and not on any extraneous elements in the background. I like the contrast of the black and white bird and the green context.",

The water line provides an excellent lead-in line which draws the viewer into the shot. Unfortunately, the image is leaning to one side.

  "use_of_camera": "I notice you didn't use a tripod and you had the iso set at 200. I would always advise any photographer to use some kind of support (perhaps a table or a wall if you don't have a tripod) and get your iso as low as possible. This will help reduce noise and improve the smoothness of the colour transitions.",
