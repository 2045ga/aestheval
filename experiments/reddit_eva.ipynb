That's more a model issue than a photographer issue, though of course it's your job to spot it and work with the model to fix it.\\n\\nF18, though? Why? Was it because you wanted to get a little bit of imperfect soft focus glow? I guess I can see that, though I don't personally like that look much.\\n\\nOverall though, it's a really nice shot.
